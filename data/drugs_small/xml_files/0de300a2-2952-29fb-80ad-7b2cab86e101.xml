                        <paragraph>After observing the response to initial therapy with oxaprozin tablets, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patientâs needs. In osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, the dosage should be individualized to the lowest effective dose of oxaprozin tablets to minimize adverse effects. The maximum recommended total daily dose of oxaprozin tablets in adults is 1,800 mg (26 mg/kg, whichever is lower) in divided doses. In children, doses greater than 1,200 mg have not been studied. Â </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients with low body weight should initiate therapy with 600 mg once daily. Patients with severe renal impairment or on dialysis should also initiate therapy with 600 mg once daily. If there is insufficient relief of symptoms in such patients, the dose may be cautiously increased to 1,200 mg, but only with close monitoring [see <content styleCode="bold">Clinical Pharmacology (<linkHtml href="#PHARMACOKINETICS">12.3</linkHtml>)</content>]. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In adults, in cases where a quick onset of action is important, the pharmacokinetics of oxaprozin allows therapy to be started with a one-time loading dose of 1,200 mg to 1,800 mg (not to exceed 26 mg/kg). Doses larger than 1,200 mg/day on a chronic basis should be reserved for patients who weigh more than 50 kg, have normal renal and hepatic function, are at low risk of peptic ulcer, and whose severity of disease justifies maximal therapy. Physicians should ensure that patients are tolerating doses in the 600 mg to 1,200 mg/day range without gastroenterologic, renal, hepatic, or dermatologic adverse effects before advancing to the larger doses. Most patients will tolerate once-a-day dosing with oxaprozin tablets, although divided doses may be tried in patients unable to tolerate single doses.</paragraph>

                     </title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Clinical trials of several cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)Â selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as oxaprozin, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [seeÂ <content styleCode="bold">Warnings and Precautions <linkHtml href="#_ea2fef38-195c-d53c-fc2c-71e27251da0e">(5.2)</linkHtml>].</content>Â </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke.

                        <paragraph>Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Avoid the use of oxaprozin in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If oxaprozin is used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>NSAIDs, including oxaprozin, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients, who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk. Â </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10 times increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, antiplatelet drugs (such as aspirin), anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding. Â </paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>NSAIDs, including oxaprozin, can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. NSAIDs can also cause fixed drug eruption (FDE). FDE may present as a more severe variant known as generalized bullous fixed drug eruption (GBFDE), which can be life-threatening. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of oxaprozin at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Oxaprozin is contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs [seeÂ <content styleCode="bold">Contraindications <linkHtml href="#CONTRAINDICATIONS"> (4)</linkHtml>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) has been reported in patients taking NSAIDs such as oxaprozin. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling. Other clinical manifestations may include hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis. Sometimes symptoms of DRESS may resemble an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its presentation, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, discontinue oxaprozin and evaluate the patient immediately.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus Avoid use of NSAIDs, including oxaprozin, in pregnant women at about 30 weeks gestation and later. NSAIDs, including oxaprozin, increase the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at approximately this gestational age. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment Use of NSAIDs, including oxaprozin, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy may cause fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. Oligohydramnios is often, but not always, reversible with treatment discontinuation. Complications of prolonged oligohydramnios may, for example, include limb contractures and delayed lung maturation. In some postmarketing cases of impaired neonatal renal function, invasive procedures such as exchange transfusion or dialysis were required. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If NSAID treatment is necessary between about 20 weeks and 30 weeks gestation, limit oxaprozin use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. Consider ultrasound monitoring of amniotic fluid if oxaprozin treatment extends beyond 48 hours. Discontinue oxaprozin if oligohydramnios occurs and follow up according to clinical practice [see <content styleCode="bold">Use in Specific Populations (8.1)</content>]. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph> Risk Summary</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Use of NSAIDs, including oxaprozin, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus and fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. Because of these risks, limit dose and duration of oxaprozin use between about 20 and 30 weeks of gestation, and avoid oxaprozin use at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy (see <content styleCode="bold">Clinical Considerations, Data</content>).</paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="italics">Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus</content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Use of NSAIDs, including oxaprozin, at about 30 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy increases the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph> Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Use of NSAIDs at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy has been associated with cases of fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Data from observational studies regarding other potential embryofetal risks of NSAID use in women in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of oxaprozin to pregnant rabbits at doses 0.1-times the maximum daily human dose (based on body surface area) resulted in evidence of teratogenicity; however, oral administration of oxaprozin to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis at doses equivalent to the maximum recommended human dose revealed no evidence of teratogenicity or embryotoxicity. In rat reproduction studies in which oxaprozin was administered through late gestation failure to deliver and a reduction in live birth index was observed at doses equivalent to the maximum recommended human dose. Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as oxaprozin, resulted in increased pre-and post-implantation loss. Prostaglandins also have been shown to have an important role in fetal kidney development. In published animal studies, prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors have been reported to impair kidney development when administered at clinically relevant doses. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population(s) is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Clinical Considerations</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus:Avoid use of NSAIDs in women at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy, because NSAIDs, including oxaprozin, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus (see <content styleCode="bold">Data</content>). </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment:If an NSAID is necessary at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy, limit the use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. If oxaprozin treatment extends beyond 48 hours, consider monitoring with ultrasound for oligohydramnios. If oligohydramnios occurs, discontinue oxaprozin and follow up according to clinical practice (see <content styleCode="bold">Data</content>). </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Labor or Delivery</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There are no studies on the effects of oxaprozin during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDS, including oxaprozin, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Data </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Human Data </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus:</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Published literature reports that the use of NSAIDs at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph> Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment:</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Published studies and postmarketing reports describe maternal NSAID use at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy associated with fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. In many cases, but not all, the decrease in amniotic fluid was transient and reversible with cessation of the drug. There have been a limited number of case reports of maternal NSAID use and neonatal renal dysfunction without oligohydramnios, some of which were irreversible. Some cases of neonatal renal dysfunction required treatment with invasive procedures, such as exchange transfusion or dialysis.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Methodological limitations of these postmarketing studies and reports include lack of a control group; limited information regarding dose, duration, and timing of drug exposure; and concomitant use of other medications. These limitations preclude establishing a reliable estimate of the risk of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes with maternal NSAID use. Because the published safety data on neonatal outcomes involved mostly preterm infants, the generalizability of certain reported risks to the full-term infant exposed to NSAIDs through maternal use is uncertain. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Animal data</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Teratology studies with oxaprozin were performed in mice, rats, and rabbits in pregnant animals administered oral doses up to 200 mg/kg/day, 200 mg/kg/day, and 30 mg/kg/day, respectively, during the period of organogenesis. In rabbits, malformations were observed at doses greater than or equal to 7.5 mg/kg/day of oxaprozin (0.1 times the maximum recommended human dailydose [MRHD] of 1,800 mg based on body surface area). However, in mice and rats, no drug-related developmental abnormalities or embryo-fetal toxicity were observed at doses up to 50 and 200 mg/kg/day of oxaprozin, respectively (0.1 times and 1.1 times the maximum recommended human daily dose of 1,800 mg based on a body surface area comparison, respectively).In fertility/reproductive studies in rats, 200 mg/kg/day oxaprozin was orally administered to female rats for 14 days prior to mating through lactation day (LD) 2, or from gestation day (GD) 15 through LD 2 and the females were mated with males treated with 200 mg/kg/day oxaprozin for 60 days prior to mating. Oxaprozin administration resulted in failure to deliver and a reduction in live birth index at 200 mg/kg/day (1.1 times the maximum recommended human daily dose of 1,800 mg based on a body surface area comparison). </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Based on the mechanism of action, the use of prostaglandin-mediated NSAIDs, including oxaprozin, may delay or prevent rupture of ovarian follicles, which has been associated with reversible infertility in some women. Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin-mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation. Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including oxaprozin, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility. Â </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Safety and effectiveness of oxaprozin in pediatric patients below the age of 6 years of age have not been established. The effectiveness of oxaprozin for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) in pediatric patients aged 6 to 16 years is supported by evidence from adequate and well controlled studies in adult rheumatoid arthritis patients, and is based on an extrapolation of the demonstrated efficacy of oxaprozin in adults with rheumatoid arthritis and the similarity in the course of the disease and the drugâs mechanism of effect between these two patient populations. Use of oxaprozin in JRA patients 6 to16 years of age is also supported by the following pediatric studies. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The pharmacokinetic profile and tolerability of oxaprozin were assessed in JRA patients relative to adult rheumatoid arthritis patients in a 14 day multiple dose pharmacokinetic study. Apparent clearance of unbound oxaprozin in JRA patients was reduced compared to adult rheumatoid arthritis patients, but this reduction could be accounted for by differences in body weight [see <content styleCode="bold">Clinical Pharmacology (<linkHtml href="#PHARMACOKINETICS">12.3</linkHtml>)].</content> No pharmacokinetic data are available for pediatric patients under 6 years. Adverse events were reported by approximately 45% of JRA patients versus an approximate 30% incidence of adverse events in the adult rheumatoid arthritis patient cohort. Most of the adverse events were related to the gastrointestinal tract and were mild to moderate. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a 3 month open label study, 10 to 20 mg/kg/day of oxaprozin were administered to 59 JRA patients. Adverse events were reported by 58% of JRA patients. Most of those reported were generally mild to moderate, tolerated by the patients, and did not interfere with continuing treatment. Gastrointestinal symptoms were the most frequently reported adverse effects and occurred at a higher incidence than those historically seen in controlled studies in adults. Fifty-two patients completed 3 months of treatment with a mean daily dose of 20 mg/kg. Of 30 patients who continued treatment (19 to 48 week range total treatment duration), nine (30%) experienced rash on sun-exposed areas of the skin and 5 of those discontinued treatment. Controlled clinical trials with oxaprozin in pediatric patients have not been conducted. </paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Oxaprozin has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The mechanism of action of oxaprozin, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2). Â </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Oxaprozin is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro. Oxaprozin concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because oxaprozin is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues. </paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In dose proportionality studies utilizing 600 mg, 1,200 mg and 1,800 mg doses, the pharmacokinetics of oxaprozin in healthy subjects demonstrated nonlinear kinetics of both the total and unbound drug in opposite directions, i.e., dose exposure related increase in the clearance of total drug and decrease in the clearance of the unbound drug. Decreased clearance of the unbound drug was related predominantly to a decrease in the volume of distribution of the unbound drug and not an increase in the elimination half-life. This phenomenon is considered to have minimal impact on drug accumulation upon multiple dosing. The pharmacokinetic parameters of oxaprozin in healthy subjects receiving a single dose or multiple once-daily doses of 1200 mg are presented in Table 3.</paragraph>

At therapeutic drug concentrations, the plasma protein binding of oxaprozin is saturable, resulting in a higher proportion of the free drug as the total drug concentration is increased. With increases in single doses or following multiple once-daily dosing, the apparent volume of distribution and clearance of total drug increased, while that of unbound drug decreased due to the effects of nonlinear protein binding.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Several oxaprozin metabolites have been identified in human urine or feces. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Oxaprozin is primarily metabolized in the liver, by both microsomal oxidation (65%) and glucuronic acid conjugation (35%). Ester and ether glucuronide are the major conjugated metabolites of oxaprozin. On chronic dosing, metabolites do not accumulate in the plasma of patients with normal renal function. Concentrations of the metabolites in plasma are very low. Â </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Oxaprozinâs metabolites do not have significant pharmacologic activity. The major ester and ether glucuronide conjugated metabolites have been evaluated along with oxaprozin in receptor binding studies and in vivo animal models and have demonstrated no activity. A small amount (&lt;5%) of active phenolic metabolites are produced, but the contribution to overall activity is limited. Â </paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Approximately 5% of the oxaprozin dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Sixty-five percent (65%) of the dose is excreted in the urine and 35% in the feces as metabolites. Biliary excretion of unchanged oxaprozin is a minor pathway, and enterohepatic recycling of oxaprozin is insignificant. Upon chronic dosing, the accumulation half-life is approximately 22 hours. The elimination half-life is approximately twice the accumulation half-life due to increased binding and decreased clearance at lower concentrations. Â </paragraph>
