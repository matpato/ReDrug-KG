                     <text>
                        <paragraph>To achieve maximum contraceptive effectiveness, NuvaRing must be used as directed <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#s2.2">Dosage and Administration (2.2)</linkHtml>]</content>. One NuvaRing is inserted in the vagina. <content styleCode="bold">The ring is to remain in place continuously for three weeks.</content> It is removed for a one-week break, during which a withdrawal bleed usually occurs. A new ring is inserted one week after the last ring was removed.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The user can choose the insertion position that is most comfortable to her, for example, standing with one leg up, squatting, or lying down. The ring is to be compressed and inserted into the vagina. The exact position of NuvaRing inside the vagina is not critical for its function. The vaginal ring must be inserted on the appropriate day and left in place for three consecutive weeks. This means that the ring should be removed three weeks later on the same day of the week as it was inserted and at about the same time.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>NuvaRing can be removed by hooking the index finger under the forward rim or by grasping the rim between the index and middle finger and pulling it out. The used ring should be placed in the sachet (foil pouch) and discarded in a waste receptacle out of the reach of children and pets (do not flush in toilet).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>After a one-week break, during which a withdrawal bleed usually occurs, a new ring is inserted on the same day of the week as it was inserted in the previous cycle. The withdrawal bleed usually starts on Day 2-3 after removal of the ring and may not have finished before the next ring is inserted. In order to maintain contraceptive effectiveness, the new ring must be inserted exactly one week after the previous one was removed even if menstrual bleeding has not finished.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>NuvaRing (etonogestrel/ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring) is a non-biodegradable, flexible, transparent, colorless to almost colorless, combination contraceptive vaginal ring, with an outer diameter of 54 mm and a cross-sectional diameter of 4 mm. It is made of ethylene vinylacetate copolymers and magnesium stearate, and contains 11.7 mg etonogestrel and 2.7 mg ethinyl estradiol. When placed in the vagina, each ring releases on average 0.120 mg/day of etonogestrel and 0.015 mg/day of ethinyl estradiol over a three-week period of use.

                        <paragraph>Stop NuvaRing use if an arterial thrombotic or venous thromboembolic event (VTE) occurs. Stop NuvaRing use if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. <content styleCode="italics">[See <linkHtml href="#s6">Adverse Reactions (6)</linkHtml>.]</content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If feasible, stop NuvaRing at least four weeks before and through two weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism, and during and following prolonged immobilization.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Start NuvaRing no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The use of CHCs increases the risk of VTE. Known risk factors for VTE include smoking, obesity, and family history of VTE, in addition to other factors that contraindicate use of CHCs <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#s4">Contraindications (4)</linkHtml>].</content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Two epidemiologic studies<sup>1, 2, 3</sup> that assessed the risk of VTE associated with the use of NuvaRing are described below.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In these studies, which were required or sponsored by regulatory agencies, NuvaRing users had a risk of VTE similar to Combined Oral Contraceptives (COCs) users (see <linkHtml href="#table1">Table 1</linkHtml> for adjusted hazard ratios). A large prospective, observational study, the Transatlantic Active Surveillance on Cardiovascular Safety of NuvaRing (TASC), investigated the risk of VTE for new users, and women who were switching to or restarting NuvaRing or COCs in a population that is representative of routine clinical users. The women were followed for 24 to 48 months. The results showed a similar risk of VTE among NuvaRing users (VTE incidence 8.3 per 10,000 WY) and women using COCs (VTE incidence 9.2 per 10,000 WY). For women using COCs that did not contain the progestins desogestrel (DSG) or gestodene (GSD), VTE incidence was 8.9 per 10,000 WY.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A retrospective cohort study using data from 4 health plans in the US (FDA-funded Study in Kaiser Permanente and Medicaid databases) showed the VTE incidence for new users of NuvaRing to be 11.4 events per 10,000 WY, for new users of a levonorgestrel (LNG)-containing COC 9.2 events per 10,000 WY, and for users of other COCs available during the course of the study<footnote>Includes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: norgestimate, norethindrone, or levonorgestrel.</footnote> 8.2 events per 10,000 WY.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The frequency of VTE in women using CHCs has been estimated to be 3 to 12 cases per 10,000 women-years.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of CHC use and after restarting a CHC following a break of at least four weeks. The risk of VTE due to CHCs gradually disappears after use is discontinued.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Figure 1 shows the risk of developing a VTE for women who are not pregnant and do not use CHCs, for women who use CHCs, for pregnant women, and for women in the postpartum period. To put the risk of developing a VTE into perspective: If 10,000 women who are not pregnant and do not use CHCs are followed for one year, between 1 and 5 of these women will develop a VTE.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Several epidemiology studies indicate that third generation oral contraceptives, including those containing desogestrel (etonogestrel, the progestin in NuvaRing, is the biologically active metabolite of desogestrel), may be associated with a higher risk of VTE than oral contraceptives containing other progestins. Some of these studies indicate an approximate two-fold increased risk. However, data from other studies have not shown this two-fold increase in risk.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Use of CHCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. CHCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes). In general, the risk is greatest among older (&gt;35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Unscheduled bleeding (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in women using CHCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different CHC.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Bleeding patterns were evaluated in three large clinical studies. In the North American study (US and Canada, N=1,177), the percentages of subjects with breakthrough bleeding/spotting ranged from 7.2% to 11.7% during cycles 1-13. In the two non-US studies, the percentages of subjects with breakthrough bleeding/spotting ranged from 2.6% to 6.4% (Europe, N=1,145) and from 2.0% to 8.7% (Europe, Brazil, Chile, N=512).</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>CHCs containing ethinyl estradiol may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds (e.g., cyclosporine, prednisolone, theophylline, tizanidine, and voriconazole) and increase their plasma concentrations. CHCs have been shown to decrease plasma concentrations of acetaminophen, clofibric acid, morphine, salicylic acid and temazepam. A significant decrease in the plasma concentrations of lamotrigine has been shown, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid-binding globulin increase with use of CHCs.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>NuvaRing is contraindicated during pregnancy because there is no need for pregnancy prevention in a woman who is already pregnant. Epidemiologic studies and meta-analyses have not shown an increased risk of genital or non-genital birth defects (including cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects) following maternal exposure to low dose CHCs prior to conception or during early pregnancy. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in pregnant rats and rabbits with the administration of etonogestrel during organogenesis at doses approximately 300 times the anticipated daily vaginal human dose (~0.002 mg/kg/day).</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in pregnant rats and rabbits with the co-administration of the combination desogestrel/ethinyl estradiol during organogenesis at desogestrel/ethinyl estradiol doses at least 2/5 times, respectively, the anticipated daily vaginal human dose (~0.002 desogestrel/0.00025 ethinyl estradiol mg/kg/day).</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Discontinue NuvaRing use if pregnancy is confirmed.</paragraph>

Co-administration of a maternally toxic dose of desogestrel/ethinyl estradiol to pregnant rats was associated with embryolethality and wavy ribs at a desogestrel/ethinyl estradiol dose that was 40/130 times, respectively, the anticipated vaginal human dose (0.002 desogestrel/0.00025 ethinyl estradiol mg/kg/day). No adverse embryofetal effects were observed when the combination was administered to pregnant rats at a desogestrel/ethinyl estradiol dose that was 4/13 times, respectively, the anticipated vaginal human dose. When desogestrel/ethinyl estradiol was given to pregnant rabbits, pre-implantation loss was observed at a desogestrel/ethinyl estradiol dose that was 3/10 times, respectively, the anticipated vaginal human dose. No adverse embryofetal effects were observed when the combination was administered to pregnant rabbits at a desogestrel/ethinyl estradiol dose that was 2/5 times the anticipated vaginal human dose.</paragraph>

Harmful effects have not been observed in breastfed infants exposed to CHCs through breast milk. CHCs can reduce milk production in breastfeeding mothers. This is less likely to occur once breastfeeding is well-established; however, it can occur at any time in some women.</paragraph>

               <text>
                  <paragraph>NuvaRing (etonogestrel/ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring) is a non-biodegradable, flexible, transparent, colorless to almost colorless, combination contraceptive vaginal ring containing two active components, a progestin, etonogestrel (13-ethyl-17-hydroxy-11-methylene-18,19-dinor-17Î±-pregn-4-en-20-yn-3-one) and an estrogen, ethinyl estradiol (19-nor-17Î±-pregna-1,3,5(10)-trien-20-yne-3,17-diol). When placed in the vagina, each ring releases on average 0.120 mg/day of etonogestrel and 0.015 mg/day of ethinyl estradiol over a three-week period of use. NuvaRing is made of ethylene vinylacetate copolymers (28% and 9% vinylacetate) and magnesium stearate and contains 11.7 mg etonogestrel and 2.7 mg ethinyl estradiol. NuvaRing is not made with natural rubber latex. NuvaRing has an outer diameter of 54 mm and a cross-sectional diameter of 4 mm. The molecular weights for etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol are 324.46 and 296.40, respectively.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Combination hormonal contraceptives act by suppression of gonadotropins. Although the primary effect of this action is inhibition of ovulation, other alterations include changes in the cervical mucus (which increase the difficulty of sperm entry into the uterus) and the endometrium (which reduce the likelihood of implantation).</paragraph>

These are present as free metabolites and as sulfate and glucuronide conjugates. The hydroxylated ethinyl estradiol metabolites have weak estrogenic activity. The biological activity of etonogestrel metabolites is unknown.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>NuvaRing (NEW-vah-ring) is a flexible birth control vaginal ring used to prevent pregnancy.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>NuvaRing contains a combination of a progestin and estrogen, 2 kinds of female hormones. Birth control methods that contain both an estrogen and a progestin are called combination hormonal contraceptives (CHCs). </paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Your chance of getting pregnant depends on how well you follow the directions for using NuvaRing. The better you follow the directions, the less chance you have of getting pregnant.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Based on the results of a US clinical study, approximately 1 to 3 women out of 100 women may get pregnant during the first year they use NuvaRing.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The following chart shows the chance of getting pregnant for women who use different methods of birth control. Each box on the chart contains a list of birth control methods that are similar in effectiveness. The most effective methods are at the top of the chart. The box on the bottom of the chart shows the chance of getting pregnant for women who do not use birth control and are trying to get pregnant.</paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>It is not known if hormonal birth control causes breast cancer. Some studies, but not all, suggest that there could be a slight increase in the risk of breast cancer among current users with longer duration of use.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>If you have breast cancer now, or have had it in the past, do not use hormonal birth control because some breast cancers are sensitive to hormones.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Women who use hormonal birth control methods may have a slightly higher chance of getting cervical cancer. However, this may be due to other reasons such as having more sexual partners. </paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>When you use NuvaRing you may have bleeding and spotting between periods, called unplanned bleeding. Unplanned bleeding may vary from slight staining between menstrual periods to breakthrough bleeding, which is a flow much like a regular period. Unplanned bleeding occurs most often during the first few months of NuvaRing use, but may also occur after you have been using NuvaRing for some time. Such bleeding may be temporary and usually does not indicate any serious problems. It is important to continue using the ring on schedule. If the unplanned bleeding or spotting is heavy or lasts for more than a few days, you should discuss this with your healthcare provider.</paragraph>
