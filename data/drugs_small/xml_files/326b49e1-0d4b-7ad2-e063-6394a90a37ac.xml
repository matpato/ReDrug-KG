                  <paragraph>Tetracyclines are readily absorbed and are bound to plasma proteins in varying degree. They are concentrated by the liver in the bile, and excreted in the urine and feces at high concentrations and in a biologically active form.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Following a single 100 mg dose administered in a concentration of 0.4 mg/mL in a one-hour infusion, normal adult volunteers averaged a peak of 2.5 mcg/mL, while 200 mg of a concentration of 0.4 mg/mL administered over two hours averaged a peak of  3.6 mcg/mL.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Excretion of doxycycline by the kidney is about 40 percent/72 hours in individuals with normal function (creatinine clearance about 75 mL/min). This percentage of excretion may fall as low as 1 to 5 percent/72 hours in individuals with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance below 10 mL/min). Studies have shown no significant difference in serum half-life of doxycycline (range 18 to 22 hours) in individuals with normal and severely impaired renal function.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Population pharmacokinetic analysis of sparse concentration-time data of doxycycline following standard of care intravenous and oral dosing in 44 pediatric patients (2-18 years of age) showed that allometrically-scaled clearance (CL) of doxycycline in pediatric patients â‰¥2 to â‰¤8 years of age (median [range] 3.58 [2.27-10.82] L/h/70 kg, N=11) did not differ significantly from pediatric patients Ëƒ8 to 18 years of age (3.27 [1.11-8.12] L/h/70 kg, N=33). For pediatric patients weighing â‰¤45 kg, body weight normalized doxycycline CL in those â‰¥2 to â‰¤8 years of age (median [range] 0.071 [0.041-0.202] L/kg/h, N=10) did not differ significantly from those Ëƒ8 to 18 years of age (0.081 [0.035-0.126] L/kg/h, N=8) In pediatric patients weighing Ëƒ45 kg, no clinically significant differences in body weight normalized doxycycline CL were observed between those â‰¥2 to â‰¤8 years of age (0.050 L/kg/h, N=1) and those Ëƒ8 to 18 years of age (0.044 [0.014-0.121] L/kg/h, N=25). No clinically significant difference in CL between oral and IV dosing was observed in the small cohort of  pediatric patients who received the oral (N=19) or IV (N=21) formulation alone.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drugs but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Use doxycycline in pediatric patients 8 years of age or less only when the potential benefits are expected to outweigh the risks in severe or life-threatening conditions (e.g., anthrax, Rocky Mountain spotted fever), particularly when there are no alternative therapies.</paragraph>

Fixed drug eruptions have occurred with doxycycline and have been associated with worsening severity upon subsequent administrations, including generalized bullous fixed drug eruption (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). If severe skin reactions occur, discontinue doxycycline immediately and institute appropriate therapy.</paragraph>

Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and doxycycline should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including doxycycline should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When doxycycline is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by doxycycline or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

                           <br/>
Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial drugs, which usually ends when the antibacterials are discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterial drugs, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibacterial drug. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.

                  <paragraph>When diluted with Lactated Ringerâ€™s Injection, USP, or Dextrose 5% in Lactated Ringerâ€™s, infusion of the solution (ca. 1 mg/mL) or lower concentrations (not less than 0.1 mg/mL) must be completed within six hours after reconstitution to ensure adequate stability. During infusion, the solution must be protected from direct sunlight. Solutions must be used within this time period or discarded.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Solutions of doxycycline for injection, at a concentration of 10 mg/mL in Sterile Water for Injection, when frozen immediately after reconstitution are stable for eight weeks when stored at â€“20Â°C. If the product is warmed, care should be taken to avoid heating it after the thawing is complete. Once thawed the solution should not be refrozen.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.</paragraph>
