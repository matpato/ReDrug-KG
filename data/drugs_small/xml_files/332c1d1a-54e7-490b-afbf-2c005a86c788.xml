                     <content styleCode="bold">Antidepressants increased the risk compared to placebo of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults in short-term studies of major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Anyone considering the use of Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets or any other antidepressant in a child, adolescent, or young adult must balance this risk with the clinical need. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction in risk with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. Depression and certain other psychiatric disorders are themselves associated with increases in the risk of suicide. Patients of all ages who are started on antidepressant therapy should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior. Families and caregivers should be advised of the need for close observation and communication with the prescriber. Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets are not approved for use in pediatric patients except for patients with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) <content styleCode="italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#i4i_section_id_b642e2ad-f7a6-4987-ad0a-d1cf0bd7aba6">5.1</linkHtml>)]</content>.</content>

                        <paragraph>The recommended starting dose for Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets in pediatric populations (ages 8-17 years) is 25 mg, administered as a single daily dose at bedtime. In a controlled clinical trial establishing the effectiveness of Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets in OCD, pediatric patients (ages 8-17) were titrated within a dose range of 50 to 200 mg/day. Physicians should consider age and gender differences when dosing pediatric patients. The maximum dose in children up to age 11 should not exceed 200 mg/day. Therapeutic effect in female children may be achieved with lower doses. Dose adjustment in adolescents (up to the adult maximum dose of 300 mg) may be indicated to achieve therapeutic benefit. The dose should be increased in 25 mg increments every 4 to 7 days, as tolerated, until maximum therapeutic benefit is achieved. It is advisable that a total daily dose of more than 50 mg should be given in two divided doses. If the two divided doses are not equal, the larger dose should be given at bedtime.</paragraph>

                     <title>2.5 Use of Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets with Other MAOIs such as Linezolid or Methylene Blue</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Do not start Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets in a patient who is being treated with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue because there is an increased risk of serotonin syndrome. In a patient who requires more urgent treatment of a psychiatric condition, other interventions, including hospitalization, should be considered <content styleCode="italics">[see Contraindications (<linkHtml href="#i4i_contraindications_id_b9d52ebd-048a-4291-bad6-016a32172c9a">4</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In some cases, a patient already receiving Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets therapy may require urgent treatment with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. If acceptable alternatives to linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are not available and the potential benefits of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are judged to outweigh the risks of serotonin syndrome in a particular patient, Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets should be stopped promptly, and linezolid or intravenous methylene blue can be administered. The patient should be monitored for symptoms of serotonin syndrome for two weeks or until 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue, whichever comes first. Therapy with Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets may be resumed 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue <content styleCode="italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#i4i_section_id_b87e1100-a913-44a8-a8e5-5e7940f03e91">5.2</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The risk of administering methylene blue by non-intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than 1 mg/kg with Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets is unclear.  The clinician should, nevertheless, be aware of the possibility of emergent symptoms of serotonin syndrome with such use <content styleCode="italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#i4i_section_id_b87e1100-a913-44a8-a8e5-5e7940f03e91">5.2</linkHtml>)]</content>.  </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>It is generally agreed that obsessive compulsive disorder requires several months or longer of sustained pharmacologic therapy. The benefit of maintaining patients with OCD on Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets after achieving a response for an average duration of about 4 weeks in a 10-week single-blind phase during which patients were titrated to effect was demonstrated in a controlled trial <content styleCode="italics">[see Clinical Trials (<linkHtml href="#i4i_section_id_b94a2997-456d-4070-8427-38319f129678">14.2</linkHtml>)]</content>.

                        <paragraph>Symptoms associated with discontinuation of other SSRIs or SNRIs have been reported <content styleCode="italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#i4i_section_id_b3d606c2-22a8-42cf-bfd0-7aa4863378c7">5.9</linkHtml>)]</content>. Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate.</paragraph>

                     <title>5.1 Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk </title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18-24) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in Table <linkHtml href="#_Refid_2be06bc7-0435-4a8f-87f5-d705a482b">1</linkHtml>.</paragraph>

It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression.

                        <paragraph>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets, can precipitate serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition. The risk is increased with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, meperidine, methadone, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John's Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin, i.e., MAOIs <content styleCode="italics">[see Contraindications (<linkHtml href="#i4i_contraindications_id_b9d52ebd-048a-4291-bad6-016a32172c9a">4</linkHtml>), Drug Interactions (<linkHtml href="#i4i_section_id_e9299998-9923-42ee-9ec6-48909db8a016">7.1</linkHtml>)]</content>. Serotonin syndrome can also occur when these drugs are used alone. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Serotonin syndrome signs and symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The concomitant use of Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets with MAOIs is contraindicated. In addition, do not initiate Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets in a patient being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection). If it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets, discontinue Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets before initiating treatment with the MAOI <content styleCode="italics">[see Contraindications (<linkHtml href="#i4i_contraindications_id_b9d52ebd-048a-4291-bad6-016a32172c9a">4</linkHtml>), Drug Interactions (<linkHtml href="#i4i_section_id_bcb1ab17-5178-4e59-8d6b-4afdc245b97c">7.2</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>

Discontinue treatment with Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. If concomitant use of Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome and monitor for symptoms.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The effect of fluvoxamine (25 mg b.i.d. for one week) on thioridazine steady-state concentrations was evaluated in 10 male inpatients with schizophrenia. Concentrations of thioridazine and its two active metabolites, mesoridazine and sulforidazine, increased threefold following coadministration of fluvoxamine.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Thioridazine administration produces a dose-related prolongation of the QTc interval, which is associated with serious ventricular arrhythmias, such as torsades de pointes-type arrhythmias, and sudden death. It is likely that this experience underestimates the degree of risk that might occur with higher doses of thioridazine. Moreover, the effect of fluvoxamine may be even more pronounced when it is administered at higher doses.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Fluvoxamine is a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2 and tizanidine is a CYP1A2 substrate. The effect of fluvoxamine (100 mg daily for 4 days) on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine has been studied in 10 healthy male subjects. Tizanidine C<sub>max</sub> was increased approximately 12-fold (range 5-fold to 32-fold), elimination half-life was increased by almost 3-fold, and AUC increased 33-fold (range 14-fold to 103-fold). The mean maximal effect on blood pressure was a 35 mm Hg decrease in systolic blood pressure, a 20 mm Hg decrease in diastolic blood pressure, and a 4 beat/min decrease in heart rate. Drowsiness was significantly increased and performance on the psychomotor task was significantly impaired.

                     <title>5.6 Potential Pimozide Interaction</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Pimozide is metabolized by the cytochrome P4503A4 isoenzyme, and it has been demonstrated that ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, blocks the metabolism of this drug, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of parent drug. An increased plasma concentration of pimozide causes QT prolongation and has been associated with torsades de pointes-type ventricular tachycardia, sometimes fatal. As noted below, a substantial pharmacokinetic interaction has been observed for fluvoxamine in combination with alprazolam, a drug that is known to be metabolized by CYP3A4. Although it has not been definitively demonstrated that fluvoxamine is a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, it is likely to be, given the substantial interaction of fluvoxamine with alprazolam. Consequently, it is recommended that fluvoxamine not be used in combination with pimozide <content styleCode="italics">[see Contraindications (<linkHtml href="#i4i_contraindications_id_b9d52ebd-048a-4291-bad6-016a32172c9a">4</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Because alosetron is metabolized by a variety of hepatic CYP drug metabolizing enzymes, inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance of alosetron. Fluvoxamine is a known potent inhibitor of CYP1A2 and also inhibits CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. In a pharmacokinetic study, 40 healthy female subjects received fluvoxamine in escalating doses from 50 mg to 200 mg a day for 16 days, with coadministration of alosetron 1 mg on the last day. Fluvoxamine increased mean alosetron plasma concentration (AUC) approximately 6-fold and prolonged the half-life by approximately 3-fold. <content styleCode="italics">[See Contraindications (<linkHtml href="#i4i_contraindications_id_b9d52ebd-048a-4291-bad6-016a32172c9a">4</linkHtml>) and Lotronex<sup>TM</sup> (alosetron) package insert]</content>.</paragraph>

                           </content>Benzodiazepines metabolized by hepatic oxidation (e.g., alprazolam, midazolam, triazolam, etc.) should be used with caution because the clearance of these drugs is likely to be reduced by fluvoxamine. The clearance of benzodiazepines metabolized by glucuronidation (e.g., lorazepam, oxazepam, temazepam) is unlikely to be affected by fluvoxamine.</paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="bold">Alprazolam </content>- When fluvoxamine maleate (100 mg q.d.) and alprazolam (1 mg q.i.d.) were coadministered to steady state, plasma concentrations and other pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC, C<sub>max</sub>, T<sub>½</sub>) of alprazolam were approximately twice those observed when alprazolam was administered alone; oral clearance was reduced by about 50%. The elevated plasma alprazolam concentrations resulted in decreased psychomotor performance and memory. This interaction, which has not been investigated using higher doses of fluvoxamine, may be more pronounced if a 300 mg daily dose is coadministered, particularly since fluvoxamine exhibits non-linear pharmacokinetics over the dosage range 100-300 mg. If alprazolam is coadministered with Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets, the initial alprazolam dosage should be at least halved and titration to the lowest effective dose is recommended. No dosage adjustment is required for Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets.</paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="bold">Diazepam</content> - The coadministration of Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets and diazepam is generally not advisable. Because fluvoxamine reduces the clearance of both diazepam and its active metabolite, N-desmethyldiazepam, there is a strong likelihood of substantial accumulation of both species during chronic coadministration.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Evidence supporting the conclusion that it is inadvisable to coadminister fluvoxamine and diazepam is derived from a study in which healthy volunteers taking 150 mg/day of fluvoxamine were administered a single oral dose of 10 mg of diazepam. In these subjects (N=8), the clearance of diazepam was reduced by 65% and that of N-desmethyldiazepam to a level that was too low to measure over the course of the 2 week long study.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>It is likely that this experience significantly underestimates the degree of accumulation that might occur with repeated diazepam administration. Moreover, as noted with alprazolam, the effect of fluvoxamine may even be more pronounced when it is administered at higher doses.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Accordingly, diazepam and fluvoxamine should not ordinarily be coadministered.</paragraph>

Since clozapine-related seizures and orthostatic hypotension appear to be dose related, the risk of these adverse events may be higher when fluvoxamine and clozapine are coadministered. Patients should be closely monitored when fluvoxamine maleate and clozapine are used concurrently.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>During marketing of Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets and other SSRIs and SNRIs (serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), there have been spontaneous reports of adverse events occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, particularly when abrupt, including the following: dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesias, such as electric shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia and hypomania. While these events are generally self-limiting, there have been reports of serious discontinuation symptoms.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets.

                        <paragraph>Use of SSRIs, including Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets, may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction <content styleCode="italics">[see Adverse Reactions (<linkHtml href="#i4i_section_id_d469afd6-30fa-40a0-ae80-9d6e8e66eca1">6.4</linkHtml>)]</content>. In male patients, SSRI use may result in ejaculatory delay or failure, decreased libido, and erectile dysfunction. In female patients, SSRI use may result in decreased libido and delayed or absent orgasm.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>It is important for prescribers to inquire about sexual function prior to initiation of Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets and to inquire specifically about changes in sexual function during treatment, because sexual function may not be spontaneously reported. When evaluating changes in sexual function, obtaining a detailed history (including timing of symptom onset) is important because sexual symptoms may have other causes, including the underlying psychiatric disorder. Discuss potential management strategies to support patients in making informed decisions about treatment.</paragraph>

In general, adverse reaction rates were similar in the two data sets as well as in the pediatric OCD study. The most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets and likely to be drug-related (incidence of 5% or greater and at least twice that for placebo) derived from Table <linkHtml href="#_Refid_0b45b4e8-cc1a-4d95-8d0a-ce569c600">2</linkHtml> were: <content styleCode="italics">nausea, somnolence, insomnia, asthenia, nervousness, dyspepsia, abnormal ejaculation, sweating, anorexia, tremor, </content>and<content styleCode="italics"> vomiting. </content>In a pool of two studies involving only patients with OCD, the following additional reactions were identified using the above rule: <content styleCode="italics">anorgasmia, decreased libido, dry mouth, rhinitis, taste perversion, </content>and<content styleCode="italics"> urinary frequency. </content>In a study of pediatric patients with OCD, the following additional reactions were identified using the above rule: <content styleCode="italics">agitation, depression, dysmenorrhea, flatulence, hyperkinesia, </content>and<content styleCode="italics"> rash.</content>

This table shows the percentage of patients in each group who had at least one occurrence of a reaction at some time during their treatment. Reported adverse reactions were classified using a standard COSTART-based Dictionary terminology.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. The cited figures, however, do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and non-drug factors to the side-effect incidence rate in the population studied.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Although changes in sexual desire, sexual performance and sexual satisfaction often occur as manifestations of a psychiatric disorder and with aging, they may also be a consequence of pharmacologic treatment. In particular, some evidence suggests that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), can cause such untoward sexual experiences.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Reliable estimates of the incidence and severity of untoward experiences involving sexual desire, performance and satisfaction are difficult to obtain, however, in part because patients and physicians may be reluctant to discuss them. Accordingly, estimates of the incidence of untoward sexual experience and performance cited in product labeling are likely to underestimate their actual incidence.</paragraph>

                     <title>6.8 Other Reactions Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets </title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>During premarketing clinical trials conducted in North America and Europe, multiple doses of fluvoxamine maleate were administered for a combined total of 2737 patient exposures in patients suffering OCD or Major Depressive Disorder. Untoward reactions associated with this exposure were recorded by clinical investigators using descriptive terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse reactions without first grouping similar types of untoward reactions into a limited (i.e., reduced) number of standard reaction categories.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In the tabulations which follow, a standard COSTART-based Dictionary terminology has been used to classify reported adverse reactions. If the COSTART term for a reaction was so general as to be uninformative, it was replaced with a more informative term. The frequencies presented, therefore, represent the proportion of the 2737 patient exposures to multiple doses of fluvoxamine maleate who experienced a reaction of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving fluvoxamine maleate. All reported reactions are included in the list below, with the following exceptions: 1) those reactions already listed in Table <linkHtml href="#_Refid_0b45b4e8-cc1a-4d95-8d0a-ce569c600">2</linkHtml>, which tabulates incidence rates of common adverse experiences in placebo-controlled OCD and depression clinical trials, are excluded; 2) those reactions for which a drug cause was not considered likely are omitted; 3) reactions for which the COSTART term was too vague to be clinically meaningful and could not be replaced with a more informative term; and 4) reactions which were reported in only one patient and judged to not be potentially serious are not included. It is important to emphasize that, although the reactions reported did occur during treatment with fluvoxamine maleate, a causal relationship to fluvoxamine maleate has not been established.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Reactions are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse reactions are defined as those occurring on one or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse reactions are those occurring between 1/100 and 1/1000 patients; and rare adverse reactions are those occurring in less than 1/1000 patients.</paragraph>

                     <title>7.1 Potential Interactions with Drugs that Inhibit or are Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes </title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Multiple hepatic cytochrome P450 isoenzymes are involved in the oxidative biotransformation of a large number of structurally different drugs and endogenous compounds. The available knowledge concerning the relationship of fluvoxamine and the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme system has been obtained mostly from pharmacokinetic interaction studies conducted in healthy volunteers, but some preliminary <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> data are also available. Based on a finding of substantial interactions of fluvoxamine with certain of these drugs [see later parts of this section and also <content styleCode="italics">Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#i4i_warnings_precautions_id_bd6f0473-cfab-4ea9-81c2-430780effd6a">5</linkHtml>)</content>] and limited <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> data for CYP3A4, it appears that fluvoxamine inhibits several cytochrome P450 isoenzymes that are known to be involved in the metabolism of other drugs such as: CYP1A2 (e.g., warfarin, theophylline, propranolol, tizanidine), CYP2C9 (e.g., warfarin), CYP3A4 (e.g., alprazolam), and CYP2C19 (e.g., omeprazole).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>
                           <content styleCode="italics">In vitro</content> data suggest that fluvoxamine is a relatively weak inhibitor of CYP2D6.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Approximately 7% of the normal population has a genetic code that leads to reduced levels of activity of CYP2D6. Such individuals have been referred to as "poor metabolizers" (PM) of drugs such as debrisoquin, dextromethorphan, and tricyclic antidepressants. While none of the drugs studied for drug interactions significantly affected the pharmacokinetics of fluvoxamine, an <content styleCode="italics">in vivo</content> study of fluvoxamine single-dose pharmacokinetics in 13 PM subjects demonstrated altered pharmacokinetic properties compared to 16 "extensive metabolizers" (EM): mean C<sub>max</sub>, AUC, and half-life were increased by 52%, 200%, and 62%, respectively, in the PM compared to the EM group. This suggests that fluvoxamine is metabolized, at least in part, by CYP2D6. Caution is indicated in patients known to have reduced levels of CYP2D6 activity and those receiving concomitant drugs known to inhibit this cytochrome P450 isoenzyme (e.g., quinidine).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The metabolism of fluvoxamine has not been fully characterized and the effects of potent cytochrome P450 isoenzyme inhibition, such as the ketoconazole inhibition of CYP3A4, on fluvoxamine metabolism have not been studied.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A clinically significant fluvoxamine interaction is possible with drugs having a narrow therapeutic ratio such as pimozide, warfarin, theophylline, certain benzodiazepines, omeprazole and phenytoin. If Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets are to be administered together with a drug that is eliminated via oxidative metabolism and has a narrow therapeutic window, plasma levels and/or pharmacodynamic effects of the latter drug should be monitored closely, at least until steady-state conditions are reached <content styleCode="italics">[see Contraindications (<linkHtml href="#i4i_contraindications_id_b9d52ebd-048a-4291-bad6-016a32172c9a">4</linkHtml>), Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#i4i_warnings_precautions_id_bd6f0473-cfab-4ea9-81c2-430780effd6a">5</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Neonates exposed to Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets and other SSRIs or SNRIs late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These features are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs and SNRIs or, possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome <content styleCode="italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#i4i_section_id_b87e1100-a913-44a8-a8e5-5e7940f03e91">5.2</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>

In addition, 99 of these outpatients continued open-label fluvoxamine maleate treatment for up to another one to three years, equivalent to 94 patient years.

                        <paragraph>Decreased appetite and weight loss have been observed in association with the use of fluvoxamine as well as other SSRIs.

                        <paragraph>The risks, if any, that may be associated with fluvoxamine’s extended use in children and adolescents with OCD have not been systematically assessed. The prescriber should be mindful that the evidence relied upon to conclude that fluvoxamine is safe for use in children and adolescents derives from relatively short term clinical studies and from extrapolation of experience gained with adult patients. In particular, there are no studies that directly evaluate the effects of long term fluvoxamine use on the growth, cognitive behavioral development, and maturation of children and adolescents. Although there is no affirmative finding to suggest that fluvoxamine possesses a capacity to adversely affect growth, development or maturation, the absence of such findings is not compelling evidence of the absence of the potential of fluvoxamine to have adverse effects in chronic use <content styleCode="italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#i4i_section_id_b642e2ad-f7a6-4987-ad0a-d1cf0bd7aba6">5.1</linkHtml>)]</content>. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The potential for abuse, tolerance and physical dependence with fluvoxamine maleate has been studied in a nonhuman primate model. No evidence of dependency phenomena was found. The discontinuation effects of Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets were not systematically evaluated in controlled clinical trials. Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets were not systematically studied in clinical trials for potential for abuse, but there was no indication of drug-seeking behavior in clinical trials. It should be noted, however, that patients at risk for drug dependency were systematically excluded from investigational studies of fluvoxamine maleate. Generally, it is not possible to predict on the basis of preclinical or premarketing clinical experience the extent to which a CNS active drug will be misused, diverted, and/or abused once marketed. Consequently, physicians should carefully evaluate patients for a history of drug abuse and follow such patients closely, observing them for signs of fluvoxamine maleate misuse or abuse (i.e., development of tolerance, incrementation of dose, drug-seeking behavior).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The mechanism of action of fluvoxamine maleate in obsessive compulsive disorder is presumed to be linked to its specific serotonin reuptake inhibition in brain neurons. Fluvoxamine has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of the serotonin reuptake transporter in preclinical studies, both <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> and <content styleCode="italics">in vivo</content>.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> studies, fluvoxamine maleate had no significant affinity for histaminergic, alpha or beta adrenergic, muscarinic, or dopaminergic receptors.

                        <paragraph>In a dose proportionality study involving fluvoxamine maleate at 100, 200 and 300 mg/day for 10 consecutive days in 30 normal volunteers, steady state was achieved after about a week of dosing. Maximum plasma concentrations at steady state occurred within 3 to 8 hours of dosing and reached concentrations averaging 88, 283 and 546 ng/mL, respectively. Thus, fluvoxamine had nonlinear pharmacokinetics over this dose range, i.e., higher doses of fluvoxamine maleate produced disproportionately higher concentrations than predicted from the lower dose.</paragraph>

                           </content>Fluvoxamine maleate is extensively metabolized by the liver; the main metabolic routes are oxidative demethylation and deamination. Nine metabolites were identified following a 5 mg radiolabelled dose of fluvoxamine maleate, constituting approximately 85% of the urinary excretion products of fluvoxamine. The main human metabolite was fluvoxamine acid which, together with its N-acetylated analog, accounted for about 60% of the urinary excretion products. A third metabolite, fluvoxethanol, formed by oxidative deamination, accounted for about 10%. Fluvoxamine acid and fluvoxethanol were tested in an <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> assay of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition in rats; they were inactive except for a weak effect of the former metabolite on inhibition of serotonin uptake (1-2 orders of magnitude less potent than the parent compound).

                           </content> The multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of fluvoxamine were determined in male and female children (ages 6-11) and adolescents (ages 12-17). Steady-state plasma fluvoxamine concentrations were 2-3 fold higher in children than in adolescents. AUC and C<sub>max</sub> in children were 1.5- to 2.7-fold higher than that in adolescents. (See Table <linkHtml href="#_Refid_4693cb52-ac0a-49b1-960f-21b7abe71">4</linkHtml>.) As in adults, both children and adolescents exhibited nonlinear multiple-dose pharmacokinetics. Female children showed significantly higher AUC (0-12) and C<sub>max</sub> compared to male children and, therefore, lower doses of Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets may produce therapeutic benefit. (See Table <linkHtml href="#_Refid_3f546db4-9a46-4dc0-9974-1b6abd053">5</linkHtml>.) No gender differences were observed in adolescents. Steady-state plasma fluvoxamine concentrations were similar in adults and adolescents at a dose of 300 mg/day, indicating that fluvoxamine exposure was similar in these two populations. (See Table <linkHtml href="#_Refid_4693cb52-ac0a-49b1-960f-21b7abe71">4</linkHtml>.) Dose adjustment in adolescents (up to the adult maximum dose of 300 mg) may be indicated to achieve therapeutic benefit <content styleCode="italics">[see Dosage and Administration (<linkHtml href="#i4i_section_id_b3ad6497-7115-494d-a2ab-eec40d92bfb2">2.2</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The effectiveness of Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets for the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) was demonstrated in two 10-week multicenter, parallel group studies of adult outpatients. Patients in these trials were titrated to a total daily fluvoxamine maleate dose of 150 mg/day over the first two weeks of the trial, following which the dose was adjusted within a range of 100-300 mg/day (on a b.i.d. schedule), on the basis of response and tolerance. Patients in these studies had moderate to severe OCD (DSM-III-R), with mean baseline ratings on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), total score of 23. Patients receiving fluvoxamine maleate experienced mean reductions of approximately 4 to 5 units on the Y-BOCS total score, compared to a 2 unit reduction for placebo patients.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>In a maintenance trial of adult outpatients with OCD, 114 patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for OCD and with a Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) score ≥18 were titrated to an effective dose of Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets 100 to 300 mg/day as part of an initial 10-week single-blind treatment phase. Treatment response during this single-blind phase was defined as Y-BOCS scores at least 30% lower than baseline at the end of weeks 8 and 10. Of the patients who responded, their average duration of response was 4 weeks. Patients who responded during this initial phase were randomized either to continuation of Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets (N=56) or to placebo (N=58) in a double-blind phase for observation of relapse. Relapse during the double-blind phase was defined as an increase in the Y-BOCS score of at least 30% over the baseline for that phase or patient refusal to continue treatment due to a substantial increase in OCD symptoms. In the double-blind phase, patients receiving continued Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets treatment experienced, on average, a significantly lower relapse rate than those receiving placebo.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>An examination of population subgroups from this trial did not reveal any clear evidence of a differential maintenance effect on the basis of age or gender.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The effectiveness of Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets for the treatment of OCD was also demonstrated in a 10-week multicenter, parallel group study in a pediatric outpatient population (children and adolescents, ages 8-17). Patients in this study were titrated to a total daily fluvoxamine dose of approximately 100 mg/day over the first two weeks of the trial, following which the dose was adjusted within a range of 50-200 mg/day (on a b.i.d. schedule) on the basis of response and tolerance. All patients had moderate to severe OCD (DSM-III-R) with mean baseline ratings on the Children’s Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) total score of 24. Patients receiving fluvoxamine maleate experienced mean reductions of approximately six units on the CY-BOCS total score, compared to a three-unit reduction for placebo patients.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph> <br/>Post hoc exploratory analyses for gender effects on outcomes did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of gender. Further exploratory analyses revealed a prominent treatment effect in the 8-11 age group and essentially no effect in the 12-17 age group. While the significance of these results is not clear, the 2-3 fold higher steady-state plasma fluvoxamine concentrations in children compared to adolescents <content styleCode="italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (<linkHtml href="#i4i_pharmacokinetics_id_bf87c6c2-c904-43ca-9d94-032707721945">12.3</linkHtml>)]</content> is suggestive that decreased exposure in adolescents may have been a factor, and dose adjustment in adolescents (up to the adult maximum dose of 300 mg) may be indicated to achieve therapeutic benefit.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with treatment with Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets and should counsel them in the appropriate use. A patient Medication Guide about “Antidepressant Medicines, Depression and other Serious Mental Illnesses, and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions” is available for Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets.</paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient’s prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient’s presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate the need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#id_4c07cfd6-40a0-4792-b777-d3d2f5812ad2">Boxed Warning</linkHtml>, Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#i4i_section_id_b642e2ad-f7a6-4987-ad0a-d1cf0bd7aba6">5.1</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Patients should be advised that taking Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets can cause mild pupillary dilation, which in susceptible individuals, can lead to an episode of angle closure glaucoma. Pre-existing glaucoma is almost always open-angle glaucoma because angle closure glaucoma, when diagnosed, can be treated definitively with iridectomy. Open-angle glaucoma is not a risk factor for angle closure glaucoma. Patients may wish to be examined to determine whether they are susceptible to angle closure, and have a prophylactic procedure (e.g., iridectomy), if they are susceptible <content styleCode="italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#L8d7c4493-1b01-4459-a4d0-436971521aa2">5.3</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>
