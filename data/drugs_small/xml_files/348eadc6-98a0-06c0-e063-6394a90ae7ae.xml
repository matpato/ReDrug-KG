                        <paragraph>The safety data described below reflect exposure to levocetirizine dihydrochloride in 2708 patients with allergic rhinitis or chronic idiopathic urticaria in 14 controlled clinical trials of 1 week to 6 months duration.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The short-term (exposure up to 6 weeks) safety data for adults and adolescents are based upon eight clinical trials in which 1896 patients (825 males and 1071 females aged 12 years and older) were treated with levocetirizine dihydrochloride 2.5, 5, or 10 mg once daily in the evening.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The short-term safety data from pediatric patients are based upon two clinical trials in which 243 children with allergic rhinitis (162 males and 81 females 6 to 12 years of age) were treated with levocetirizine dihydrochloride 5 mg once daily for 4 to 6 weeks, one clinical trial in which 114 children (65 males and 49 females 1 to 5 years of age) with allergic rhinitis or chronic idiopathic urticaria were treated with levocetirizine dihydrochloride 1.25 mg twice daily for 2 weeks, and one clinical trial in which 45 children (28 males and 17 females 6 to 11 months of age) with symptoms of allergic rhinitis or chronic urticaria were treated with levocetirizine dihydrochloride 1.25 mg once daily for 2 weeks.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The long-term (exposure of 4 or 6 months) safety data in adults and adolescents are based upon two clinical trials in which 428 patients (190 males and 238 females) with allergic rhinitis were exposed to treatment with levocetirizine dihydrochloride 5 mg once daily. Long term safety data are also available from an 18-month trial in 255 levocetirizine dihydrochloride-treated subjects 12 to 24 months of age.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trial of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In studies up to 6 weeks in duration, the mean age of the adult and adolescent patients was 32 years, 44% of the patients were men and 56% were women, and the large majority (more than 90%) was Caucasian.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In these trials 43% and 42% of the subjects in the levocetirizine dihydrochloride 2.5 mg and 5 mg groups, respectively, had at least one adverse event compared to 43% in the placebo group.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In placebo-controlled trials of 1 to 6 weeks in duration, the most common adverse reactions were somnolence, nasopharyngitis, fatigue, dry mouth, and pharyngitis, and most were mild to moderate in intensity. Somnolence with levocetirizine dihydrochloride showed dose ordering between tested doses of 2.5, 5 and 10 mg and was the most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation (0.5%).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Table 1 lists adverse reactions that were reported in greater than or equal to 2% of subjects aged 12 years and older exposed to levocetirizine dihydrochloride 2.5 mg or 5 mg in eight placebo-controlled clinical trials and that were more common with levocetirizine dihydrochloride than placebo.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Available data from published literature and post-marketing experience with levocetirizine use in pregnant women are insufficient to identify any drug-associated risks of miscarriage, birth defects, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, there was no evidence of fetal harm with administration of levocetirizine by the oral route to pregnant rats and rabbits, during the period of organogenesis, at doses up to 390 times and 470 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) in adults. In rats treated during late gestation and the lactation period, cetirizine had no effects on pup development at oral doses up to approximately 60 times the MRHD in adults. In mice treated during late gestation and the lactation period, cetirizine administered by the oral route to the dams had no effects on pup development at a dose that was approximately 25 times the MRHD in adults; however, lower pup weight gain during lactation was observed at a dose that was 95 times the MRHD in adults

                        <paragraph>In embryo-fetal development studies, pregnant rats received daily doses of levocetirizine up to 200 mg/kg/day from gestation days 6 to 15 and pregnant rabbits received daily doses of levocetirizine up to 120 mg/kg/day from gestation days 6 to 18. Levocetirizine produced no evidence of fetal harm in rats and rabbits at doses up to 390 and 470 times the MRHD, respectively (on a mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis with maternal oral doses of 200 and 120 mg/kg/day in rats and rabbits, respectively).

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>No prenatal and postnatal development (PPND) studies in animals have been conducted with levocetirizine. In a PPND study conducted in mice, cetirizine was administered at oral doses up to 96 mg/kg/day from gestation day 15 through lactation day 21. Cetirizine lowered pup body weight gain during lactation at an oral dose in dams that was approximately 95 times the MRHD (on a mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis with a maternal oral dose of 96 mg/kg/day); however, there were no effects on pup weight gain at an oral dose in dams that was approximately 25 times the MRHD (on a mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis with a maternal oral dose of 24 mg/kg/day). In a PPND study conducted in rats, cetirizine was administered at oral doses up to 180 mg/kg/day from gestation day 17 to lactation day 22. Cetirizine did not have any adverse effects on rat dams or offspring development at doses up to approximately 60 times the MRHD (on a mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis with a maternal oral dose of 30 mg/kg/day). Cetirizine caused excessive maternal toxicity at an oral dose in dams that was approximately 350 times the MRHD (on a mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis with a maternal oral dose of 180 mg/kg/day).

                        <paragraph>Cross-study comparisons indicate that administration of a 5 mg dose of levocetirizine dihydrochloride to 6 to 12 year old pediatric patients resulted in about 2-fold the systemic exposure (AUC) observed when 5 mg of levocetirizine dihydrochloride was administered to healthy adults. Therefore, in children 6 to 11 years of age the recommended dose of 2.5 mg once daily should not be exceeded. In a population pharmacokinetics study the administration of 1.25 mg once daily in children 6 months to 5 years of age resulted in systemic exposure comparable to 5 mg once daily in adults.

                        <paragraph>Levocetirizine, the active enantiomer of cetirizine, is an antihistamine; its principal effects are mediated via selective inhibition of H
 
  <sub>1</sub>receptors. The antihistaminic activity of levocetirizine has been documented in a variety of animal and human models.
 
  <content styleCode="italics">In vitro</content>binding studies revealed that levocetirizine has an affinity for the human H
 
  <sub>1</sub>-receptor 2-fold higher than that of cetirizine (Ki = 3 nmol/L
 
  <content styleCode="italics">vs.</content>6 nmol/L, respectively). The clinical relevance of this finding is unknown.

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Studies in adult healthy subjects showed that levocetirizine at doses of 2.5 mg and 5 mg inhibited the skin wheal and flare caused by the intradermal injection of histamine. In contrast, dextrocetirizine exhibited no clear change in the inhibition of the wheal and flare reaction. Levocetirizine at a dose of 5 mg inhibited the wheal and flare caused by intradermal injection of histamine in 14 pediatric subjects (aged 6 to 11 years) and the activity persisted for at least 24 hours. The clinical relevance of histamine wheal skin testing is unknown.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A QT/QTc study using a single dose of 30 mg of levocetirizine did not demonstrate an effect on the QTc interval. While a single dose of levocetirizine had no effect, the effects of levocetirizine may not be at steady state following single dose. The effect of levocetirizine on the QTc interval following multiple dose administration is unknown. Levocetirizine is not expected to have QT/QTc effects because of the results of QTc studies with cetirizine and the long post-marketing history of cetirizine without reports of QT prolongation.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Levocetirizine exhibited linear pharmacokinetics over the therapeutic dose range in adult healthy subjects.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Levocetirizine is rapidly and extensively absorbed following oral administration. In adults, peak plasma concentrations are achieved 0.9 hour after administration of the oral tablet. The accumulation ratio following daily oral administration is 1.12 with steady state achieved after 2 days. Peak concentrations are typically 270 ng/mL and 308 ng/mL following a single and a repeated 5 mg once daily dose, respectively. Food had no effect on the extent of exposure (AUC) of the levocetirizine tablet, but T
 
  <sub>max</sub>was delayed by about 1.25 hours and C
 
  <sub>max</sub>was decreased by about 36% after administration with a high fat meal; therefore, levocetirizine can be administered with or without food.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A dose of 5 mg (10 mL) of levocetirizine dihydrochloride oral solution is bioequivalent to a 5 mg dose of levocetirizine dihydrochloride tablets. Following oral administration of a 5 mg dose of levocetirizine dihydrochloride oral solution to healthy adult subjects, the mean peak plasma concentrations were achieved approximately 0.5 hour post dose.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The extent of metabolism of levocetirizine in humans is less than 14% of the dose and therefore differences resulting from genetic polymorphism or concomitant intake of hepatic drug metabolizing enzyme inhibitors are expected to be negligible. Metabolic pathways include aromatic oxidation, N- and O-dealkylation, and taurine conjugation. Dealkylation pathways are primarily mediated by CYP3A4 while aromatic oxidation involves multiple and/or unidentified CYP isoforms.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The plasma half-life in adult healthy subjects was about 8 to 9 hours after administration of oral tablets and oral solution, and the mean oral total body clearance for levocetirizine was approximately 0.63 mL/kg/min. The major route of excretion of levocetirizine and its metabolites is via urine, accounting for a mean of 85.4% of the dose. Excretion via feces accounts for only 12.9% of the dose. Levocetirizine is excreted both by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion. Renal clearance of levocetirizine correlates with that of creatinine clearance. In patients with renal impairment the clearance of levocetirizine is reduced

                        <paragraph>Pediatric patients</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Data from a pediatric pharmacokinetic study with oral administration of a single dose of 5 mg levocetirizine in 14 children age 6 to 11 years with body weight ranging between 20 and 40 kg show that C
 
  <sub>max</sub>and AUC values are about 2-fold greater than that reported in healthy adult subjects in a cross-study comparison. The mean C
 
  <sub>max</sub>was 450 ng/mL, occurring at a mean time of 1.2 hours, weight-normalized, total body clearance was 30% greater, and the elimination half-life 24% shorter in this pediatric population than in adults.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Dedicated pharmacokinetic studies have not been conducted in pediatric patients younger than 6 years of age. A retrospective population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted in 323 subjects (181 children 1 to 5 years of age, 18 children 6 to 11 years of age, and 124 adults 18 to 55 years of age) who received single or multiple doses of levocetirizine ranging from 1.25 mg to 30 mg. Data generated from this analysis indicated that administration of 1.25 mg once daily to children 6 months to 5 years of age results in plasma concentrations similar to those of adults receiving 5 mg once daily.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Geriatric patients</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Limited pharmacokinetic data are available in elderly subjects. Following once daily repeat oral administration of 30 mg levocetirizine for 6 days in 9 elderly subjects (65 to 74 years of age), the total body clearance was approximately 33% lower compared to that in younger adults. The disposition of racemic cetirizine has been shown to be dependent on renal function rather than on age. This finding would also be applicable for levocetirizine, as levocetirizine and cetirizine are both predominantly excreted in urine. Therefore, the levocetirizine dihydrochloride dose should be adjusted in accordance with renal function in elderly patients

                        <paragraph>Gender</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Pharmacokinetic results for 77 patients (40 men, 37 women) were evaluated for potential effect of gender. The half-life was slightly shorter in women (7.08 ± 1.72 hr) than in men (8.62 ± 1.84 hr); however, the body weight-adjusted oral clearance in women (0.67 ± 0.16 mL/min/kg) appears to be comparable to that in men (0.59 ± 0.12 mL/min/kg). The same daily doses and dosing intervals are applicable for men and women with normal renal function.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Race</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The effect of race on levocetirizine has not been studied. As levocetirizine is primarily renally excreted, and there are no important racial differences in creatinine clearance, pharmacokinetic characteristics of levocetirizine are not expected to be different across races. No race-related differences in the kinetics of racemic cetirizine have been observed.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Renal impairment</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Levocetirizine exposure (AUC) exhibited 1.8-, 3.2-, 4.3-, and 5.7-fold increase in mild, moderate, severe, renal impaired, and end-stage renal disease patients, respectively, compared to healthy subjects. The corresponding increases of half-life estimates were 1.4-, 2-, 2.9-, and 4-fold, respectively.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The total body clearance of levocetirizine after oral dosing was correlated to the creatinine clearance and was progressively reduced based on severity of renal impairment. Therefore, it is recommended to adjust the dose and dosing intervals of levocetirizine based on creatinine clearance in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment. In end-stage renal disease patients (CL
 
  <sub>CR</sub>&lt; 10 mL/min) levocetirizine is contraindicated. The amount of levocetirizine removed during a standard 4-hour hemodialysis procedure was &lt;10%.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The dosage of levocetirizine dihydrochloride should be reduced in patients with mild renal impairment. Both the dosage and frequency of administration should be reduced in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment

                        <paragraph>Levocetirizine dihydrochloride has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. The non-renal clearance (indicative of hepatic contribution) was found to constitute about 28% of the total body clearance in healthy adult subjects after oral administration.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>As levocetirizine is mainly excreted unchanged by the kidney, it is unlikely that the clearance of levocetirizine is significantly decreased in patients with solely hepatic impairment

                        <paragraph>No carcinogenicity studies have been performed with levocetirizine. However, evaluation of cetirizine carcinogenicity studies is relevant for determination of the carcinogenic potential of levocetirizine. In a 2-year carcinogenicity study, in rats, cetirizine was not carcinogenic at dietary doses up to 20 mg/kg (approximately 40, 40, 25, and 10 times the MRHDs in adults, children 6 to 11 years of age, children 2 to 5 years, and children 6 months to 2 years of age, respectively, on a mg/m

  <sup>2</sup>basis). The clinical significance of these findings during long-term use of levocetirizine dihydrochloride is not known.

  <sup>2</sup>basis).

                        <paragraph>The efficacy of levocetirizine dihydrochloride was evaluated in four randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials in adult and adolescent patients 12 years and older with symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis. The four clinical trials include two dose-ranging trials of 4 weeks duration and two efficacy trials (one 6-week and one 6-month) in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>These trials included a total of 1729 patients (752 males and 977 females) of whom 227 were adolescents 12 to 17 years of age. Efficacy was assessed using a total symptom score from patient recording of 4 symptoms (sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal pruritus, and ocular pruritus) in three studies and 5 symptoms (sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal pruritus, ocular pruritus, and nasal congestion) in one study. Patients recorded symptoms using a 0 to 3 categorical severity scale (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe) once daily in the evening reflective of the 24 hour treatment period. The primary endpoint was the mean total symptom score averaged over the first week and over 4 weeks for perennial allergic rhinitis trials.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The two dose-ranging trials were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of levocetirizine dihydrochloride 2.5, 5, and 10 mg once daily in the evening. These trials were 4 weeks in duration and included patients with perennial allergic rhinitis. In these trials, each of the three doses of levocetirizine dihydrochloride demonstrated greater decrease in the reflective total symptom score than placebo and the difference was statistically significant for all three doses in the two studies. Results for one of these trials are shown in Table 4.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>One clinical trial evaluated the efficacy of levocetirizine dihydrochloride 5 mg once daily in the evening compared to placebo in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis over a 6-week treatment period. Another trial conducted over a 6-month treatment period assessed efficacy at 4 weeks. Levocetirizine dihydrochloride 5 mg demonstrated a greater decrease from baseline in the reflective total symptom score than placebo and the difference from placebo was statistically significant. Results of the former are shown in Table 5.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The efficacy of levocetirizine dihydrochloride for the treatment of the uncomplicated skin manifestations of chronic idiopathic urticaria was evaluated in two multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials of 4 weeks duration in adult patients 18 to 85 years of age with chronic idiopathic urticaria. The two trials included one 4-week dose-ranging trial and one 4-week single-dose level efficacy trial. These trials included 423 patients (139 males and 284 females). Most patients (&gt;90%) were Caucasian and the mean age was 41. Of these patients, 146 received levocetirizine dihydrochloride 5 mg once daily in the evening. Efficacy was assessed based on patient recording of pruritus severity on a severity score of 0 to 3 (0 = none to 3 = severe). The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean reflective pruritus severity score over the first week and over the entire treatment period. Additional efficacy variables were the instantaneous pruritus severity score, the number and size of wheals, and duration of pruritus.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The dose-ranging trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of levocetirizine dihydrochloride 2.5, 5, and 10 mg once daily in the evening. In this trial, each of the three doses of levocetirizine dihydrochloride demonstrated greater decrease in the reflective pruritus severity score than placebo and the difference was statistically significant for all three doses (see Table 6).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The single dose level trial evaluated the efficacy of levocetirizine dihydrochloride 5 mg once daily in the evening compared to placebo in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria over a 4-week treatment period. Levocetirizine dihydrochloride 5 mg demonstrated a greater decrease from baseline in the reflective pruritus severity score than placebo and the difference from placebo was statistically significant.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Duration of pruritus, number and size of wheals, and instantaneous pruritus severity score also showed significant improvement over placebo. The significant improvement in the instantaneous pruritus severity score over placebo confirmed end of dosing interval efficacy (see Table 6).</paragraph>
