                           <content styleCode="bold">Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of seventeen placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. Haloperidol Injection, USP is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis (see

                  <paragraph>Haloperidol is an antipsychotic.  The mechanism of action of haloperidol for the treatment of schizophrenia is unclear.  However, its efficacy could be mediated through its activity as an antagonist at central dopamine type 2 receptors.  Haloperidol also binds to alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, but with lower affinity, and displays minimal binding to muscarinic cholinergic and histaminergic (H
       
 
  <sub>1</sub>) receptors.

                        <paragraph>Cases of sudden death, QTc interval-prolongation, and Torsades de Pointes have been reported in patients receiving haloperidol injection (see 
         
 
  <linkHtml href="#s38">ADVERSE REACTIONS</linkHtml>).  Higher than recommended doses of any formulation and intravenous administration of haloperidol injection appear to be associated with a higher risk of QTc interval-prolongation and Torsades de Pointes.  Also, a QTc interval that exceeds 500 msec is associated with an increased risk of Torsades de Pointes.  Although cases have been reported even in the absence of predisposing factors, particular caution is advised in treating patients with other QTc-prolonging conditions (including electrolyte imbalance [particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia], drugs known to prolong QTc, underlying cardiac abnormalities, hypothyroidism, and familial long QT-syndrome).  HALOPERIDOL INJECTION IS NOT APPROVED FOR INTRAVENOUS ADMINISTRATION.  If haloperidol injection is administered intravenously, the ECG should be monitored for QTc prolongation and arrhythmias.

                     <title>Tardive Dyskinesia
</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>A syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs (see 
         
 
  <linkHtml href="#s38">ADVERSE REACTIONS</linkHtml>).  Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome.  Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown.

        

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Both the risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase.  However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses.
</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Tardive dyskinesia may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is discontinued.  Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.
</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Given these considerations, antipsychotic drugs should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia.  Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that, 1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and, 2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are 
         
 
  <content styleCode="bold">not</content> available or appropriate.  In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought.  The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically.

        

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on antipsychotics, drug discontinuation should be considered.  However, some patients may require treatment despite the presence of the syndrome.

                     <title>Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)
</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs (see 
         
 
  <linkHtml href="#s38">ADVERSE REACTIONS</linkHtml>). Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status (including catatonic signs) and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis) and acute renal failure.

        

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms. Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology.
</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The management of NMS should include 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for uncomplicated NMS.
</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported.
</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Hyperpyrexia and heat stroke, not associated with the above symptom complex, have also been reported with haloperidol.

There are reports, however, of cases of limb malformations observed following maternal use of haloperidol along with other drugs which have suspected teratogenic potential during the first trimester of pregnancy.  Causal relationships were not established in these cases.  Since such experience does not exclude the possibility of fetal damage due to haloperidol, this drug should be used during pregnancy or in women likely to become pregnant only if the benefit clearly justifies a potential risk to the fetus.

                        <paragraph>A number of cases of bronchopneumonia, some fatal, have followed the use of antipsychotic drugs, including haloperidol.  It has been postulated that lethargy and decreased sensation of thirst due to central inhibition may lead to dehydration, hemoconcentration and reduced pulmonary ventilation. Therefore, if the above signs and symptoms appear, especially in the elderly, the physician should institute remedial therapy promptly.

                        <paragraph>Although not reported with haloperidol, decreased serum cholesterol and/or cutaneous and ocular changes have been reported in patients receiving chemically-related drugs.

Patients with a history of a clinically significant low WBC or a drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and discontinuation of haloperidol should be considered at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors.
</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients with clinically significant neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur.  Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count &lt;1000/mm

</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Generally, patients receiving short-term therapy experience no problems with abrupt discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs. However, some patients on maintenance treatment experience transient dyskinetic signs after abrupt withdrawal. In certain of these cases the dyskinetic movements are indistinguishable from tardive dyskinesia (see 
         
 
  <linkHtml href="#s12">WARNINGS, Tardive Dyskinesia</linkHtml>) except for duration. It is not known whether gradual withdrawal of antipsychotic drugs will reduce the rate of occurrence of withdrawal emergent neurological signs but until further evidence becomes available, it seems reasonable to gradually withdraw use of haloperidol injection (see

                        <paragraph>Drug-drug interactions can be pharmacodynamic (combined pharmacologic effects) or pharmacokinetic (alteration of plasma levels).  The risks of using haloperidol in combination with other drugs have been evaluated as described below.

</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Since QTc interval-prolongation has been observed during haloperidol treatment, caution is advised when prescribing to a patient with QT-prolongation conditions or to patients receiving medications known to prolong the QTc-interval (see 
         
 
  <linkHtml href="#s10">WARNINGS, Cardiovascular Effects</linkHtml>).  Examples include (but are not limited to): Class 1A antiarrhythmics (e.g., procainamide, quinidine, disopyramide); Class 3 antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol); and other drugs such as citalopram, erythromycin, levofloxacin, methadone, and ziprasidone.

        

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Caution is advised when haloperidol is used in combination with drugs known to cause electrolyte imbalance (e.g., diuretics or corticosteroids) because hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia are risk factors for QT prolongation.
</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Haloperidol may impair the antiparkinson effects of levodopa and other dopamine agonists. If concomitant antiparkinson medication is required, it may have to be continued after haloperidol is discontinued because of the difference in excretion rates. If both are discontinued simultaneously, extrapyramidal symptoms may occur. The physician should keep in mind the possible increase in intraocular pressure when anticholinergic drugs, including antiparkinson agents, are administered concomitantly with haloperidol.
</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>As with other antipsychotic agents, it should be noted that haloperidol may be capable of potentiating CNS depressants such as anesthetics, opioids, and alcohol.

                                    <paragraph>Haloperidol is metabolized by several routes. The major pathways are glucuronidation and ketone reduction.  The cytochrome P450 enzyme system is also involved, particularly CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2D6.  Inhibition of these routes of metabolism by another drug  or a decrease in CYP2D6 enzyme may result in increased haloperidol concentrations.  The effect of CYP3A4 inhibition and of decreased CYP2D6 enzyme activity may be additive.

                                    <paragraph>The haloperidol plasma concentrations increased when a CYP3A4 and/or CYP2D6 inhibitor was coadministered with haloperidol.  Examples include:

In the rat study survival was reduced in all dose groups, decreasing the number of rats at risk for developing tumors.  However, although a relatively greater number of rats survived to the end of the study in high-dose male and female groups, these animals did not have a greater incidence of tumors than control animals.  Therefore, although not optimal, this study does suggest the absence of a haloperidol related increase in the incidence of neoplasia in rats at doses up to approximately 2.5 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 20 mg/day based on mg/m

Although disturbances such as galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown for most patients.  An increase in mammary neoplasms has been found in rodents after chronic administration of antipsychotic drugs.  Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date, however, have shown an association between chronic administration of these drugs and mammary tumorigenesis; the available evidence is considered too limited to be conclusive at this time.

                        <paragraph>There are no well controlled studies with haloperidol injection in pregnant women.  There are reports, however, of cases of limb malformations observed following maternal use of haloperidol along with other drugs which have suspected teratogenic potential during the first trimester of pregnancy.  Causal relationships were not established in these cases.  Since such experience does not exclude the possibility of fetal damage due to haloperidol, this drug should be used during pregnancy or in women likely to become pregnant only if the benefit clearly justifies a potential risk to the fetus.

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>In general, the symptoms of overdosage would be an exaggeration of known pharmacologic effects and adverse reactions, the most prominent of which would be: 1) severe extrapyramidal reactions, 2) hypotension, or 3) sedation.  The patient would appear comatose with respiratory depression and hypotension which could be severe enough to produce a shock-like state.  The extrapyramidal reactions would be manifested by muscular weakness or rigidity and a generalized or localized tremor as demonstrated by the akinetic or agitans types respectively.  With  accidental overdosage, hypertension rather than hypotension occurred in a two-year old child.  The risk of ECG changes associated with torsade de pointes should be considered.

                     <title>Treatment
</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Since there is no specific antidote, treatment is primarily supportive.  Dialysis is not recommended in the treatment of overdose because it removes only very small amounts of haloperidol.  A patent airway must be established by use of an oropharyngeal airway or endotracheal tube or, in prolonged cases of coma, by tracheostomy.  Respiratory depression may be counteracted by artificial respiration and mechanical respirators.  Hypotension and circulatory collapse may be counteracted by use of intravenous fluids, plasma, or concentrated albumin, and vasopressor agents such as metaraminol, phenylephrine and norepinephrine.  Epinephrine must not be used. In case of severe extrapyramidal reactions, antiparkinson medication should be administered.  ECG and vital signs should be monitored especially for signs of QTc-interval prolongation or dysrhythmias and monitoring should continue until the ECG is normal.

</title>
               <text>
                  <paragraph>There is considerable variation from patient to patient in the amount of medication required for treatment.  As with all drugs used to treat schizophrenia, dosage should be individualized according to the needs and response of each patient.  Dosage adjustments, either upward or downward, should be carried out as rapidly as practicable to achieve optimum therapeutic control.
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>To determine the initial dosage, consideration should be given to the patient's age, severity of illness, previous response to other antipsychotic drugs, and any concomitant medication or disease state. Debilitated or geriatric patients, as well as those with a history of adverse reactions to antipsychotic drugs, may require less haloperidol injection.  The optimal response in such patients is usually obtained with more gradual dosage adjustments and at lower dosage levels.
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Parenteral medication, administered intramuscularly in doses of 2 to 5 mg, is utilized for prompt control of the acutely agitated schizophrenic patient with moderately severe to very severe symptoms. Depending on the response of the patient, subsequent doses may be given, administered as often as every hour, although 4 to 8 hour intervals may be satisfactory.  The maximum dose is 20 mg/day.
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Controlled trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of intramuscular administration in children have not been conducted.
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

                     <title>Switchover Procedure
</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>An oral form should supplant the injectable as soon as practicable.  In the absence of bioavailability studies establishing bioequivalence between these two dosage forms the following guidelines for dosage are suggested.  For an initial approximation of the total daily dose required, the parenteral dose administered in the preceding 24 hours may be used.  Since this dose is only an initial estimate, it is recommended that careful monitoring of clinical signs and symptoms, including clinical efficacy, sedation, and adverse effects, be carried out periodically for the first several days following the initiation of switchover.  In this way, dosage adjustments, either upward or downward, can be quickly accomplished.  Depending on the patient's clinical status, the first oral dose should be given within 12-24 hours following the last parenteral dose.
