                           <br/> There is inter-patient variability in the potency of opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Therefore, a conservative approach is advised when determining the total daily dosage of Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution. It is safer to underestimate a patient’s 24-hour Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution than to overestimate the 24-hour Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to overdose. If a patient has been receiving opioid-containing medications prior to taking Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution, the potency of the prior opioid relative to oxycodone should be factored into the selection of the total daily dose (TDD) of oxycodone.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In converting patients from other opioids to Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution, close observation and adjustment of dosage based upon the patient’s response to Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution is imperative. Administration of supplemental analgesia for breakthrough or incident pain and titration of the total daily dose of Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution may be necessary, especially in patients who have disease states that are changing rapidly.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Do not abruptly discontinue Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution in patients who may be physically dependent on opioids. Rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics in patients who are physically dependent on opioids has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. Patients may also attempt to treat their pain or withdrawal symptoms with illicit opioids, such as heroin, and other substances.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>When a decision has been made to decrease the dose or discontinue therapy in an opioid- dependent patient taking Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution, there are a variety of factors that should be considered, including the dose of opioid (including Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution) the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, the type of pain being treated, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. It is important to ensure ongoing care of the patient and to agree on an appropriate tapering schedule and follow-up plan so that patient and provider goals and expectations are clear and realistic. When opioid analgesics are being discontinued due to a suspected substance use disorder, evaluate and treat the patient, or refer for evaluation and treatment of the substance use disorder. Treatment should include evidence-based approaches, such as medication assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. Complex patients with co-morbid pain and substance use disorders may benefit from referral to a specialist.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There are no standard opioid tapering schedules that are suitable for all patients. Good clinical practice dictates a patient-specific plan to taper the dose of the opioid gradually. For patients on Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution who are physically opioid- dependent, initiate the taper by a small enough increment (e.g., no greater than 10% to 25% of the total daily dose) to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and proceed with dose- lowering at an interval of every 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who have been taking opioids for briefer periods of time may tolerate a more rapid taper.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>It may be necessary to provide the patient with lower dosage strengths to accomplish a successful taper. Reassess the patient frequently to manage pain and withdrawal symptoms, should they emerge. Common withdrawal symptoms include restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint<br/> pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. If withdrawal symptoms arise, it may be necessary to pause the taper for a period of time or raise the dose of the opioid analgesic to the previous dose, and then proceed with a slower taper. In addition, monitor patients for any changes in mood, emergence of suicidal thoughts, or use of<br/> other substances.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>When managing patients taking opioid analgesics, particularly those who have been treated for a long duration and/or with high doses for chronic pain, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper. A multimodal approach to pain management may optimize the treatment of chronic pain, as well as assist with the successful tapering of the opioid analgesic <content styleCode="italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#S5.15">5.15</linkHtml>), Drug Abuse and Dependence (<linkHtml href="#S9.3">9.3</linkHtml>)].</content>

                           <br/> Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused.<br/> Assess each patient’s risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution, and reassess all patients receiving Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression).<br/> The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution along with frequent reevaluation for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse.

                        <paragraph>Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution with benzodiazepines and/or other CNS depressants, including alcohol (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics <content styleCode="italics">[see Drug Interactions (<linkHtml href="#S7">7</linkHtml>)].</content>

                        <paragraph> If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Inform patients and caregivers of this potential interaction and educate them on the signs and symptoms of respiratory depression (including sedation).

                        <paragraph>Concomitant use of Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution with a CYP3A4 inhibitor, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g.,ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may increase plasma concentrations of oxycodone and prolong opioid adverse reactions, which may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#S5.3">5.3</linkHtml>)], particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution is achieved. Similarly, discontinuation of a CYP3A4 inducer, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, in Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution treated patients may increase oxycodone plasma concentrations and prolong opioid adverse reactions.

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. This condition differs from tolerance, which is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect <content styleCode="italics">[see Dependence (<linkHtml href="#S9.3">9.3</linkHtml>)]. </content>Symptoms of OIH include (but may not be limited to) increased levels of pain upon opioid dosage increase, decreased levels of pain upon opioid dosage decrease, or pain from ordinarily non-painful stimuli (allodynia). These symptoms may suggest OIH only if there is no evidence of underlying disease progression, opioid tolerance, opioid withdrawal, or addictive behavior.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Cases of OIH have been reported, both with short-term and longer-term use of opioid analgesics. Though the mechanism of OIH is not fully understood, multiple biochemical pathways have been implicated. Medical literature suggests a strong biologic plausibility between opioid analgesics and OIH and allodynia. If a patient is suspected to be experiencing OIH, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation (safely switching the patient to a different opioid moiety) <content styleCode="italics">[see Dosage and Administration (<linkHtml href="#L5fafd7a2-b38c-427c-9a78-017001687255">2.5</linkHtml>), Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#S5.15">5.15)</linkHtml>]</content>

The most frequent adverse events include nausea, constipation, vomiting, headache, and pruritus. The frequency of these reactions depended on several factors, including clinical setting, the patient’s level of opioid tolerance, and host factors specific to the individual.<br/> In all patients for whom dosing information was available (n = 191) from the open-label and double-blind studies involving another formulation of immediate-release oxycodone, the following adverse events were recorded in oxycodone treated patients with an incidence ≥ 3%. In descending order of frequency, they were: nausea, constipation, vomiting, headache, pruritus, insomnia, dizziness, asthenia, and somnolence.<br/> The other less frequently observed adverse reactions from opioid analgesics, including Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution included:</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution is not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression.</paragraph>

                           <br/> Available data from lactation studies indicate that oxycodone is present in breastmilk and that doses of less than 60 mg/day of the immediate-release formulation are unlikely to result in clinically relevant exposures in breastfed infants. A pharmacokinetics study utilizing opportunistic sampling of 76 lactating women receiving oxycodone immediate release products for postpartum pain management showed that oxycodone concentrates in breastmilk with an average milk to plasma ratio of 3.2. The relative infant dose was low, approximately 1.3% of a weight-adjusted maternal dose (see Data).<br/> In the same study, among the 70 infants exposed to oxycodone in breastmilk, no adverse events were attributed to oxycodone. However, based on known adverse effects in adults, infants should be monitored for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression (see Clinical Considerations). There are no data on the effects of the oxycodone on milk production.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or from the underlying maternal condition.</paragraph>

                           <br/> Monitor infants exposed to Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution through breast milk for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped, or when breastfeeding is stopped.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Data<br/> Oxycodone concentration data from 76 lactating women receiving immediate-release oxycodone products for postpartum pain management, and 28 infants exposed to oxycodone in breastmilk showed that following a median (range) dose of oxycodone in mothers of 9.2 (5-10) mg/dose or 33.0 (5.4-59.3) mg/day, oxycodone concentrated in breastmilk with a median(range) milk to plasma ratio of 3.2 (1.2-5.3). However, when using maternal breastmilk data to estimate the daily and relative infant dose, the infant dose was 0.006 mg/kg/day, which is 1.3% of a weight-adjusted maternal dose of 10 mg every 6 hours. These estimates based on maternal breastmilk concentrations were corroborated by the observed infant concentrations, of which over 75% (19/25) were below the limit of quantification. Among the 6 infants with quantifiable concentration, the median (range) concentration was 0.2 ng/mL (0.1-0.7).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>These concentrations are 100 to 1000 times lower than concentrations observed in other studies after infants received oxycodone at mg/kg/dose (~20-200 ng/mL).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity to oxycodone. In general, use caution when selecting a dose for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.<br/> Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution slowly in geriatric patients and frequently reevaluate the patient closely for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression <content styleCode="italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#S5.9">5.9</linkHtml>)].<br/>

                        <paragraph>Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution contains oxycodone, a substance with a high potential for misuse and abuse, which can lead to the development of substance use disorder, including addiction<content styleCode="italics"> [see Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#S5.2">5.2</linkHtml>)].</content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a healthcare provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence.<br/> Misuse and abuse of Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution increases risk of overdose, which may lead to central nervous system and respiratory depression, hypotension, seizures, and death. The risk is increased with concurrent abuse of Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution with alcohol and/or other CNS depressants. Abuse of and addiction to opioids in some individuals may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of addiction.<br/> All patients treated with opioids require careful and frequent reevaluation for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Patients at high risk of Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution abuse include those with a history of prolonged use any opioid, including products containing oxycodone, those with a history of drug or alcohol abuse, or those who use Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution in combination with other abused drugs.<br/> “Drug-seeking” behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders, Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated “loss” of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare provider(s). “Doctor shopping” (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among people who abuse drugs and people with substance use disorder. Preoccupation<br/> with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with inadequate pain control.<br/> Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution, like other opioids, can be diverted for nonmedical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised.<br/> Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.<br/>

                           <br/> Abuse of Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution poses a risk of overdose and death. This risk is increased with concurrent use of Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution with alcohol and/or other CNS depressants.<br/> Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution is approved for oral use only.<br/> Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during use of opioid therapy. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose).<br/> Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of a physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Withdrawal may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued use.<br/> Do not abruptly discontinue Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution in a patient physically dependent on opioids. Rapid tapering of Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking or abuse.<br/> When discontinuing Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution, gradually taper the dosage using a patient-specific plan that considers the following: the dose of Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. To improve the likelihood of a successful taper and minimize withdrawal symptoms, it is important that the opioid tapering schedule is agreed upon by the patient. In patients taking opioids for an extended period of time at high doses, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper <content styleCode="italics">[see Dosage and Administration (<linkHtml href="#L5fafd7a2-b38c-427c-9a78-017001687255">2.5</linkHtml>), Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#S5.15">5.15</linkHtml>)].<br/>

                           <br/> In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support measures.<br/> Opioid antagonists, such as naloxone, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to opioid overdose, administer an opioid antagonist.<br/> Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of oxycodone in Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably re-established. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer antagonist as directed by the product’s prescribing information.<br/> In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be initiated with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Oxycodone is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of oxycodone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect for analgesia with oxycodone. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression. The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been<br/> identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug.</paragraph>

                                 <br/> Oxycodone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical stimulation.<br/> Oxycodone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations.</paragraph>

                                 <br/> Oxycodone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase.</paragraph>

                                 <br/> Oxycodone hydrochloride is extensively metabolized to noroxycodone, oxymorphone, noroxymorphone, which are subsequently glucuronidated. CYP3A4 mediated N-demethylation to noroxycodone is the primary metabolic pathway of oxycodone with a less contribution from CYP2D6 mediated O-demethylation to oxymorphone. Therefore, the formation of these and related metabolites can, in theory, be affected by other drugs. The major circulating metabolite is noroxycodone with an AUC ratio of 0.6 relative to that of oxycodone. Noroxycodone is reported to be a considerably weaker<br/> analgesic than oxycodone. Oxymorphone, although possessing analgesic activity, is present in the plasma only in low concentrations. The correlation between oxymorphone concentrations and opioid effects was much less than that seen with oxycodone plasma concentrations. The analgesic activity profile of other metabolites is not known.</paragraph>
