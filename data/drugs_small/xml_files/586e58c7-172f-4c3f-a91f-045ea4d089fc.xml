                        <paragraph>Treatment with roflumilast is associated with an increase in psychiatric adverse reactions. In 8 controlled clinical trials 5.9% (263) of patients treated with roflumilast 500 mcg daily reported psychiatric adverse reactions compared to 3.3% (137) treated with placebo. The most commonly reported psychiatric adverse reactions were insomnia, anxiety, and depression which were reported at higher rates in those treated with roflumilast 500 mcg daily (2.4%, 1.4%, and 1.2% for roflumilast versus 1.0%, 0.9%, and 0.9% for placebo, respectively) <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Section_6.1">Adverse Reactions (6.1)</linkHtml>]</content>. Instances of suicidal ideation and behavior, including completed suicide, have been observed in clinical trials. Three patients experienced suicide-related adverse reactions (one completed suicide and two suicide attempts) while receiving roflumilast compared to one patient (suicidal ideation) who received placebo. One patient completed suicide while receiving roflumilast in Trial 9 <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Section_14.1">Clinical Studies (14.1)</linkHtml>]</content>, which assessed the effect of adding roflumilast to a fixed-dose combination (FDC) of ICS/LABA on rates of exacerbations in COPD patients over 1 year of treatment. Cases of suicidal ideation and behavior, including completed suicide, have been observed in the post-marketing setting in patients with or without a history of depression. <content styleCode="italics"> </content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Before using roflumilast in patients with a history of depression and/or suicidal thoughts or behavior, prescribers should carefully weigh the risks and benefits of treatment with roflumilast in such patients. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of insomnia, anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts or other mood changes, and if such changes occur to contact their healthcare provider. Prescribers should carefully evaluate the risks and benefits of continuing treatment with roflumilast if such events occur.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Weight loss was a common adverse reaction in roflumilast clinical trials and was reported in 7.5% (331) of patients treated with roflumilast 500 mcg once daily compared to 2.1% (89) treated with placebo <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Section_6.1">Adverse Reactions (6.1)</linkHtml>]</content>. In addition to being reported as adverse reactions, weight was prospectively assessed in two placebo-controlled clinical trials of one year duration. In these studies, 20% of patients receiving roflumilast experienced moderate weight loss (defined as between 5 to 10% of body weight) compared to 7% of patients who received placebo. In addition, 7% of patients who received roflumilast compared to 2% of patients receiving placebo experienced severe (&gt;10% body weight) weight loss. During follow-up after treatment discontinuation, the majority of patients with weight loss regained some of the weight they had lost while receiving roflumilast. Patients treated with roflumilast should have their weight monitored regularly. If unexplained or clinically significant weight loss occurs, weight loss should be evaluated, and discontinuation of roflumilast should be considered.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>A major step in roflumilast metabolism is the N-oxidation of roflumilast to roflumilast N-oxide by CYP3A4 and CYP1A2. The administration of the cytochrome P450 enzyme inducer rifampicin resulted in a reduction in exposure, which may result in a decrease in the therapeutic effectiveness of roflumilast. Therefore, the use of strong cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers (e.g., rifampicin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin) with roflumilast is not recommended <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Section_7.1">Drug Interactions (7.1)</linkHtml> and  <linkHtml href="#Section_12.3">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>The safety data described below reflect exposure of 4438 patients to roflumilast 500 mcg once daily in four 1-year placebo-controlled trials, two 6-month placebo-controlled trials, and two 6-month drug add-on trials <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Section_14.1">Clinical Studies (14.1)</linkHtml>]. </content>In these trials, 3136 and 1232 COPD patients were exposed to roflumilast 500 mcg once daily for 6 months and 1 year, respectively.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>The population had a median age of 64 years (range 40 to 91), 73% were male, 92.9% were Caucasian, and had COPD with a mean pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) of 8.9 to 89.1% predicted. In these trials, 68.5% of the patients treated with roflumilast reported an adverse reaction compared with 65.3% treated with placebo.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse reaction was 14.8% for roflumilast-treated patients and 9.9% for placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse reactions that led to discontinuation of roflumilast were diarrhea (2.4%) and nausea (1.6%).</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Serious adverse reactions, whether considered drug-related or not by the investigators, which occurred more frequently in roflumilast-treated patients include diarrhea, atrial fibrillation, lung cancer, prostate cancer, acute pancreatitis, and acute renal failure.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The following adverse reactions have been identified from spontaneous reports of roflumilast received worldwide and have not been listed elsewhere. These adverse reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of seriousness, frequency of reporting or potential causal connection to roflumilast. Because these adverse reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to roflumilast exposure: hypersensitivity reactions (including angioedema, urticaria, and rash), gynecomastia.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>There are no randomized clinical studies of roflumilast in pregnant women. In animal reproductive toxicity studies, roflumilast administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis produced no fetal structural abnormalities. The highest roflumilast dose in these studies was approximately 30 and 26 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). Roflumilast induced post-implantation loss in rats at doses greater than or equal to approximately 10 times the MRHD. Roflumilast induced stillbirth and decreased pup viability in mice at doses corresponding to approximately 16 and 49 times, respectively, the MRHD. Roflumilast has been shown to adversely affect pup post-natal development when dams were treated with the drug during pregnancy and lactation periods in mice at doses corresponding to 49 times the MRHD (<content styleCode="italics">see Data</content>).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In an embryo-fetal development study, pregnant rats were dosed orally during the period of organogenesis with up to 1.8 mg/kg/day roflumilast (approximately 30 times the MRHD on an AUC basis). No evidence of structural abnormalities or effects on survival rates were observed. Roflumilast did not affect embryo-fetal development at approximately 3 times the MRHD (on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis at a maternal oral dose of 0.2 mg/kg/day). </paragraph>

Roflumilast induced pre- and post-implantation loss at doses greater than or equal to approximately 10 times the MRHD (on a mg/m<sup>2 </sup>basis at maternal oral doses greater than or equal to 0.6 mg/kg/day). Roflumilast did not cause fetal structural abnormalities at exposures up to approximately 29 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 1.8 mg/kg/day). </paragraph>

Roflumilast induced delivery retardation in pregnant mice at doses greater or equal to approximately 16 times the MRHD (on a mg/m<sup>2 </sup>basis at maternal doses &gt;2 mg/kg/day). Roflumilast decreased pup rearing frequencies at approximately 49 times the MRHD (on a mg/m<sup>2 </sup>basis at a maternal dose of 6 mg/kg/day) during pregnancy and lactation. Roflumilast also decreased survival and forelimb grip reflex and delayed pinna detachment in mouse pups at approximately 97 times the MRHD (on a mg/m<sup>2 </sup>basis at a maternal dose of 12 mg/kg/day).</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Roflumilast and its active metabolite (roflumilast N-oxide) are selective inhibitors of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4). Roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide inhibition of PDE4 (a major cyclic-3′,5′-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP)-metabolizing enzyme in lung tissue) activity leads to accumulation of intracellular cyclic AMP. While the specific mechanism(s) by which roflumilast exerts its therapeutic action in COPD patients is not well defined, it is thought to be related to the effects of increased intracellular cyclic AMP in lung cells.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In COPD patients, 4-week treatment with roflumilast 500 mcg oral once daily reduced sputum neutrophils and eosinophils by 31%, and 42%, respectively. In a pharmacodynamic study in healthy volunteers, roflumilast 500 mcg once daily reduced the number of total cells, neutrophils and eosinophils found in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid following segmental pulmonary lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge by 35%, 38% and 73%, respectively. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.</paragraph>

                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>The absolute bioavailability of roflumilast following a 500 mcg oral dose is approximately 80%. Maximum plasma concentrations (C<sub>max</sub>) of roflumilast typically occur approximately one hour after dosing (ranging from  0.5 to 2 hours) in the fasted state while plateau-like maximum concentrations of the N-oxide metabolite are reached in approximately eight hours (ranging from 4 to 13 hours). Food has no effect on total drug absorption, but delays time to maximum concentration (T<sub>max</sub>) of roflumilast by one hour and reduces C<sub>max</sub> by approximately 40%, however, C<sub>max</sub> and T<sub>max</sub> of roflumilast N-oxide are unaffected. An <content styleCode="italics">in vitro </content>study showed that roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide did not inhibit P-gp transporter. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Plasma protein binding of roflumilast and its N-oxide metabolite is approximately 99% and 97%, respectively. Volume of distribution for single-dose 500 mcg roflumilast is about 2.9 L/kg. Studies in rats with radiolabeled roflumilast indicate low penetration across the blood-brain barrier. </paragraph>

                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Roflumilast is extensively metabolized via Phase I (cytochrome P450) and Phase II (conjugation) reactions. The N-oxide metabolite is the only major metabolite observed in the plasma of humans. Together, roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide account for the majority (87.5%) of total dose administered in plasma. In urine, roflumilast was not detectable while roflumilast N-oxide was only a trace metabolite (less than 1%). Other conjugated metabolites such as roflumilast N-oxide glucuronide and 4-amino-3,5-dichloropyridine N-oxide were detected in urine. </paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>While roflumilast is three times more potent than roflumilast N-oxide at inhibition of the PDE4 enzyme <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content>, the plasma AUC of roflumilast N-oxide on average is about 10-fold greater than the plasma AUC of roflumilast. </paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="italics">In vitro </content>studies and clinical drug-drug interaction studies suggest that the biotransformation of roflumilast to its N-oxide metabolite is mediated by CYP1A2 and 3A4. Based on further <content styleCode="italics">in vitro </content>results in human liver microsomes, therapeutic plasma concentrations of roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide do not inhibit CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4/5, or 4A9/11. Therefore, there is a low probability of relevant interactions with substances metabolized by these P450 enzymes. In addition, <content styleCode="italics">in vitro </content>studies demonstrated no induction of the CYP 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4/5 and only a weak induction of CYP2B6 by roflumilast. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The plasma clearance after short-term intravenous infusion of roflumilast is on average about 9.6 L/h. Following an oral dose, the median plasma effective half-life of roflumilast and its N-oxide metabolite are approximately 17 and 30 hours, respectively. Steady state plasma concentrations of roflumilast and its N-oxide metabolite are reached after approximately 4 days for roflumilast and 6 days for roflumilast N-oxide following once-daily dosing. Following intravenous or oral administration of radiolabeled roflumilast, about 70% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Long-term studies were conducted in hamsters and mice with roflumilast to evaluate its carcinogenic potential. In 2-year oral gavage carcinogenicity studies, roflumilast treatment resulted in dose-related, statistically significant increases in the incidence of undifferentiated carcinomas of nasal epithelium in hamsters at ≥8 mg/kg/day (approximately 11 times the MRHD based on summed AUCs of roflumilast and its metabolites). The tumorigenicity of roflumilast appears to be attributed to a reactive metabolite of 4-amino-3,5-dichloropyridine N-oxide (ADCP N-oxide). No evidence of tumorigenicity was observed in mice at roflumilast oral doses up to 12 and 18 mg/kg/day in females and males, respectively (approximately 10 and 15 times the MRHD, respectively, based on summed AUCs of roflumilast and its metabolites). </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In a human spermatogenesis study, roflumilast 500 mcg had no effects on semen parameters or reproductive hormones during the 3-month treatment period and the following 3-month off-treatment period. In a fertility study, roflumilast decreased fertility rates in male rats at 1.8 mg/kg/day (approximately 29 times the MRHD on a mg/m<sup>2 </sup>basis). The male rats also showed increases in the incidence of tubular atrophy, degeneration in the testis and spermiogenic granuloma in the epididymides. No effect on rat fertility rate or male reproductive organ morphology was observed at 0.6 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the MRHD on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis). In a female fertility study, no effect on fertility was observed up to the highest roflumilast dose of 1.5 mg/kg/day in rats (approximately 24 times the MRHD on a mg/m<sup>2 </sup>basis).</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The efficacy and safety of roflumilast in COPD was evaluated in 8 randomized, double-blind, controlled, parallel-group clinical trials in 9394 adult patients (4425 receiving roflumilast 500 mcg) 40 years of age and older with COPD. Of the 8 trials, two were placebo-controlled dose selection trials (Trials 1 and 2) of 6 months’ duration that evaluated the efficacy of roflumilast 250 mcg and 500 mcg once daily, four were placebo-controlled 1-year trials (Trials 3, 4, 5, and 6) primarily designed to evaluate the efficacy of roflumilast on COPD exacerbations, and two were 6-month efficacy trials (Trials 7 and 8) which assessed the effect of roflumilast as add-on therapy to a long-acting beta agonist or long-acting anti-muscarinic. The 8 trials enrolled patients with nonreversible obstructive lung disease (FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ≤70% and ≤12% or 200 mL improvement in FEV<sub>1</sub> in response to 4 puffs of albuterol/salbutamol) but the severity of airflow obstruction at baseline was different among the trials. Patients enrolled in the dose selection trials had the full range of COPD severity (FEV<sub>1</sub> 30 to 80% predicted); median age of 63 years, 73% male, and 99% Caucasian. Patients enrolled in the four exacerbation trials had severe COPD (FEV<sub>1</sub> ≤50% predicted); median age of 64 years, 74% male, and 90% Caucasian.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Patients enrolled in the two 6-month efficacy trials had moderate to severe COPD (FEV<sub>1</sub> 40 to 70% predicted); median age of 65 years, 68% male, and 97% Caucasian. COPD exacerbations and lung function (FEV<sub>1</sub>) were co-primary efficacy outcome measures in the four 1-year trials. In the two 6-month supportive efficacy trials, lung function (FEV<sub>1</sub>) alone was the primary efficacy outcome measure.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>The two 6-month dose-selection efficacy trials (Trials 1 and 2) explored doses of 250 mcg and 500 mcg once daily in a total of 1929 patients (751 and 724 on roflumilast 250 and 500 mcg, respectively). The selection of the 500 mcg dose was primarily based on nominal improvements in lung function (FEV<sub>1</sub>) over the 250 mcg dose. The once-daily dosing regimen was primarily based on the determination of a plasma half-life of 17 hours for roflumilast and 30 hours for its active metabolite roflumilast N-oxide <content styleCode="italics">[see <content styleCode="underline">

                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>An additional placebo-controlled 1-year trial (Trial 9) evaluated the effect of roflumilast 500 mcg on COPD exacerbations when added to a fixed-dose combination (FDC) product containing an inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta agonist (ICS/LABA). At screening, patients were required to have two or more exacerbations in the previous year. This trial randomized a total of 2354 patients (1178 randomized to roflumilast, 1176 to placebo). Approximately 60% of the patients enrolled had severe COPD (postbronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> 30% to 50% of predicted) associated with chronic bronchitis and 39% had very severe COPD (postbronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub>≤ 30% of predicted) associated with chronic bronchitis; mean age of 64 years, 69% male, and 80% Caucasian. The use of long-acting muscarinic antagonists was allowed.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The effect of roflumilast 500 mcg once daily on COPD exacerbations was evaluated in five 1-year trials (Trials 3, 4, 5, 6 and 9).</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Two of the trials (Trials 3 and 4) conducted initially enrolled a population of patients with severe COPD (FEV<sub>1</sub>≤50% of predicted) inclusive of those with chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema who had a history of smoking of at least 10 pack years. Inhaled corticosteroids were allowed as concomitant medications and used in 61% of both roflumilast and placebo-treated patients and short-acting beta agonists were allowed as rescue therapy. The use of long-acting beta agonists, long-acting anti-muscarinics, and theophylline were prohibited. The rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations was a co-primary endpoint in both trials. There was not a symptomatic definition of exacerbation in these 2 trials. Exacerbations were defined in terms of severity requiring treatment with a moderate exacerbation defined as treatment with systemic glucocorticosteroids in Trial 3 or systemic glucocorticosteroids and/or antibiotics in Trial 4 and a severe exacerbation defined as requiring hospitalizations and/or leading to death in Trial 3 or requiring hospitalization in Trial 4. The trials randomized 1176 patients (567 on roflumilast) in Trial 3 and 1514 patients (760 on roflumilast) in Trial 4. Both trials failed to demonstrate a significant reduction in the rate of COPD exacerbations.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Exploratory analyses of the results of Trials 3 and 4 identified a subpopulation of patients with severe COPD associated with chronic bronchitis and COPD exacerbations within the previous year that appeared to demonstrate a better response in the reduction of the rate of COPD exacerbations compared to the overall population. As a result, two subsequent trials (Trial 5 and Trial 6) were conducted that enrolled patients with severe COPD but associated with chronic bronchitis, at least one COPD exacerbation in the previous year, and at least a 20 pack-year smoking history. In these trials, long-acting beta agonists and short-acting anti-muscarinics were allowed and were used by 44% and 35% of patients treated with roflumilast and 45% and 37% of patients treated with placebo, respectively. The use of inhaled corticosteroids was prohibited. As in trials 3 and 4, the rate of moderate exacerbations (defined as requiring intervention with systemic glucocorticosteroids) or severe exacerbations (defined as leading to hospitalization and/or to death) was a co-primary endpoint.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Trial 5 randomized a total of 1525 patients (765 on roflumilast) and Trial 6 randomized a total of 1571 patients (772 on roflumilast). In both trials, roflumilast 500 mcg once daily demonstrated a significant reduction in the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations compared to placebo (Table 2). These two trials provide the evidence to support the use of roflumilast for the reduction of COPD exacerbations. </paragraph>

In each of these trials roflumilast 500 mcg once daily demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in FEV<sub>1</sub> which averaged approximately 50 mL across the four trials.

At screening, patients were required to have had at least one exacerbation in the previous year. A total of 1323 patients were randomized to receive roflumilast 500 mcg once a day for 12 weeks (n=443), roflumilast 500 mcg every other day for 4 weeks followed by roflumilast 500 mcg once a day for 8 weeks (n=439), or roflumilast 250 mcg once a day for 4 weeks followed by roflumilast 500 mcg once a day for 8 weeks (n=441).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Over the 12 week study period, the percentage of patients discontinuing treatment was 6.2% lower in patients initially receiving roflumilast 250 mcg daily for 4 weeks followed by roflumilast 500 mcg daily for 8 weeks (18.4%) compared to those receiving roflumilast 500 mcg daily for 12 weeks (24.6%) (Odds Ratio = 0.66; 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.93; p=0.017). Because this trial was limited to 12 weeks in duration, whether initiation of dosing with roflumilast 250 mcg improves the long term tolerability of roflumilast 500 mcg has not been determined.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Treatment with roflumilast is associated with an increase in psychiatric adverse reactions. Cases of suicidal ideation and behavior, including completed suicide, have been observed in the post-marketing setting in patients with or without a history of depression. The risks and benefits of treatment with roflumilast in patients with a history of depression and/or suicidal thoughts or behavior should be carefully considered. Advise patients, caregivers, and families to be alert for the emergence or worsening of insomnia, anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts or other mood changes, and if such changes occur to contact their healthcare provider so that the risks and benefits of continuing treatment with roflumilast may be considered <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Section_5.2">Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</linkHtml>]. </content>

During follow-up after treatment discontinuation, the majority of patients with weight loss regained some of the weight they had lost while receiving roflumilast. Advise patients treated with roflumilast to have their weight monitored regularly. If unexplained weight loss occurs, patients should inform their healthcare provider so that the weight loss can be evaluated, as discontinuation of roflumilast may need to be considered <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Section_5.3">Warnings and Precautions (5.3)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>
