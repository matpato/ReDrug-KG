                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Zafirlukast is a selective and competitive receptor antagonist of leukotriene D<sub>4</sub> and E<sub>4</sub> (LTD<sub>4</sub> and LTE<sub>4</sub>), components of slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRSA).  Cysteinyl leukotriene production and receptor occupation have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma, including airway edema, smooth muscle constriction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of asthma. Patients with asthma were found in one study to be 25 to 100 times more sensitive to the bronchoconstricting activity of inhaled LTD<sub>4</sub> than nonasthmatic subjects.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="italics">In vitro</content> studies demonstrated that zafirlukast antagonized the contractile activity of three leukotrienes (LTC<sub>4</sub>, LTD<sub>4</sub> and LTE<sub>4</sub>) in conducting airway smooth muscle from laboratory animals and humans.  Zafirlukast prevented intradermal LTD<sub>4</sub>-induced increases in cutaneous vascular permeability and inhibited inhaled LTD<sub>4</sub>-induced influx of eosinophils into animal lungs.  Inhalational challenge studies in sensitized sheep showed that zafirlukast suppressed the airway responses to antigen; this included both the early- and late-phase response and the nonspecific hyperresponsiveness.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In humans, zafirlukast inhibited bronchoconstriction caused by several kinds of inhalational challenges.  Pretreatment with single oral doses of zafirlukast inhibited the bronchoconstriction caused by sulfur dioxide and cold air in patients with asthma.  Pretreatment with single doses of zafirlukast attenuated the early- and late-phase reaction caused by inhalation of various antigens such as grass, cat dander, ragweed, and mixed antigens in patients with asthma. Zafirlukast also attenuated the increase in bronchial hyperresponsiveness to inhaled histamine that followed inhaled allergen challenge.</paragraph>

                     <content styleCode="bold">Absorption</content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Zafirlukast is rapidly absorbed following oral administration.  Peak plasma concentrations are generally achieved 3 hours after oral administration.  The absolute bioavailability of zafirlukast is unknown.  In two separate studies, one using a high fat and the other a high protein meal, administration of zafirlukast with food reduced the mean bioavailability by approximately 40%.</paragraph>

                     <content styleCode="bold">Distribution</content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Zafirlukast is more than 99% bound to plasma proteins, predominantly albumin.  The degree of binding was independent of concentration in the clinically relevant range. The apparent steady-state volume of distribution (Vss/F) is approximately 70 L, suggesting moderate distribution into tissues.  Studies in rats using radiolabeled zafirlukast indicate minimal distribution across the blood-brain barrier.</paragraph>

                     <content styleCode="bold">Metabolism</content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Zafirlukast is extensively metabolized.  The most common metabolic products are hydroxylated metabolites which are excreted in the feces.  The metabolites of zafirlukast identified in plasma are at least 90 times less potent as LTD<sub>4</sub> receptor antagonists than zafirlukast in a standard <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> test of activity.  <content styleCode="italics">In vitro</content> studies using human liver microsomes showed that the hydroxylated metabolites of zafirlukast excreted in the feces are formed through the cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) pathway.  Additional <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> studies utilizing human liver microsomes show that zafirlukast inhibits the cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 isoenzymes at concentrations close to the clinically achieved total plasma concentrations (see <content styleCode="bold">Drug Interactions</content>).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Excretion</content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The apparent oral clearance (CL/f) of zafirlukast is approximately 20 L/h.  Studies in the rat and dog suggest that biliary excretion is the primary route of excretion.  Following oral administration of radiolabeled zafirlukast to volunteers, urinary excretion accounts for approximately 10% of the dose and the remainder is excreted in feces.  Zafirlukast is not detected in urine.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In the pivotal bioequivalence study, the mean terminal half-life of zafirlukast is approximately 10 hours in both normal adult subjects and patients with asthma.  In other studies, the mean plasma half-life of zafirlukast ranged from approximately 8 to 16 hours in both normal subjects and patients with asthma.  The pharmacokinetics of zafirlukast are approximately linear over the range from 5 mg to 80 mg.  Steady-state plasma concentrations of zafirlukast are proportional to the dose and predictable from single-dose pharmacokinetic data.  Accumulation of zafirlukast in the plasma following twice-daily dosing is approximately 45%.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The pharmacokinetic parameters of zafirlukast 20 mg administered as a single dose to 36 male volunteers are shown with the table below.</paragraph>

Zafirlukast exposure is likely to be increased by other moderate and      strong CYP2C9 inhibitors.

                  <paragraph>Liver function tests, in particular serum ALT, should be measured immediately and the patient managed accordingly.  If liver function tests are consistent with hepatic dysfunction, zafirlukast therapy should not be resumed.  Patients in whom zafirlukast was withdrawn because of hepatic dysfunction where no other attributable cause is identified should not be re-exposed to zafirlukast (see <content styleCode="bold">PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients </content>and <content styleCode="bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS</content>).</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Zafirlukast is indicated for the chronic treatment of asthma and should be taken regularly as prescribed, even during symptom-free periods.  Zafirlukast is not a bronchodilator and should not be used to treat acute episodes of asthma.  Patients receiving zafirlukast should be instructed not to decrease the dose or stop taking any other antiasthma medications unless instructed by a physician. Patients should be instructed to notify their physician if neuropsychiatric events occur while using zafirlukast (see <content styleCode="bold">PRECAUTIONS, Neuropsychiatric Events</content>). Women who are breast-feeding should be instructed not to take zafirlukast (see <content styleCode="bold">PRECAUTIONS, Nursing Mothers</content>). Alternative antiasthma medication should be considered in such patients.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Neuropsychiatric events have been reported in adult, adolescent and pediatric patients taking zafirlukast.  Post-marketing reports with zafirlukast include insomnia and depression.  The clinical details of some post-marketing reports involving zafirlukast appear consistent with a drug-induced effect.  Patients and prescribers should be alert for neuropsychiatric events.  Patients should be instructed to notify their prescriber if these changes occur.  Prescribers should carefully evaluate the risks and benefits of continuing treatment with zafirlukast if such events occur (see <content styleCode="bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS</content>).</paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In a drug interaction study in 16 healthy male volunteers, coadministration of multiple doses of zafirlukast (160 mg/day) to steady-state with a single 25 mg dose of warfarin resulted in a significant increase in the mean AUC (+ 63%) and half-life (+36%) of S-warfarin.  The mean prothrombin time (PT) increased by approximately 35%.  This interaction is probably due to an inhibition by zafirlukast of the cytochrome P450 2C9 isoenzyme system.  Patients on oral warfarin anticoagulant therapy and zafirlukast should have their prothrombin times monitored closely and anticoagulant dose adjusted accordingly (see <content styleCode="bold">WARNINGS, Concomitant Warfarin Administration</content>).  No formal drug-drug interaction studies with zafirlukast and other drugs known to be metabolized by the cytochrome P450 2C9 isoenzyme (e.g., tolbutamide, phenytoin, carbamazepine) have been conducted; however, care should be exercised when zafirlukast is coadministered with these drugs<content styleCode="bold">.</content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In a drug interaction study in 11 asthmatic patients, coadministration of a single dose of zafirlukast (40 mg) with erythromycin (500 mg three times daily for 5 days) to steady-state resulted in decreased mean plasma levels of zafirlukast by approximately 40% due to a decrease in zafirlukast bioavailability.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Coadministration of zafirlukast (20 mg/day) or placebo at steady-state with a single dose of sustained release theophylline preparation (16 mg/kg) in 16 healthy boys and girls (6 through 11 years of age) resulted in no significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters of theophylline.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Coadministration of zafirlukast (80 mg/day) at steady-state with a single dose of a liquid theophylline preparation (6 mg/kg) in 13 asthmatic patients, 18 to 44 years of age, resulted in decreased mean plasma levels of zafirlukast by approximately 30%, but no effect on plasma theophylline levels was observed.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Rare cases of patients experiencing increased theophylline levels with or without clinical signs or symptoms of theophylline toxicity after the addition of zafirlukast to an existing theophylline regimen have been reported.  The mechanism of the interaction between zafirlukast and theophylline in these patients is unknown (see <content styleCode="bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS</content>).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Coadministration of zafirlukast (40 mg/day) with aspirin (650 mg four times daily) resulted in mean increased plasma levels of zafirlukast by approximately 45%.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In a single-blind, parallel-group, 3-week study in 39 healthy female subjects taking oral contraceptives, 40 mg twice daily of zafirlukast had no significant effect on ethinyl estradiol plasma concentrations or contraceptive efficacy.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Coadministration of zafirlukast with fluconazole, a moderate CYP2C9 inhibitor, resulted in increased plasma levels of zafirlukast, by approximately 58% (90% CI:28, 95). The clinical significance of this interaction is unknown. Zafirlukast exposure is likely to be increased by other moderate and strong CYP2C9 inhibitors. Coadministration of zafirlukast with itraconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, caused no change in plasma levels of zafirlukast.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>No other formal drug-drug interaction studies between zafirlukast and marketed drugs known to be metabolized by the P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) isoenzyme (e.g., dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers, cyclosporin, cisapride) have been conducted. As zafirlukast is known to be an inhibitor of CYP3A4 <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content>, it is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when these drugs are coadministered with zafirlukast.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>In two-year carcinogenicity studies, zafirlukast was administered at dietary doses of 10, 100, and 300 mg/kg to mice and 40, 400, and 2000 mg/kg to rats.  Male mice at an oral dose of 300 mg/kg/day (approximately 30 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults and in children on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis) showed an increased incidence of hepatocellular adenomas; female mice at this dose showed a greater incidence of whole body histocytic sarcomas.  Male and female rats at an oral dose of 2000 mg/kg/day (resulting in approximately 160 times the exposure to drug plus metabolites from the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults and in children based on a comparison of the plasma area-under the curve [AUC] values) of zafirlukast showed an increased incidence of urinary bladder transitional cell papillomas. Zafirlukast was not tumorigenic at oral doses up to 100 mg/kg (approximately 10 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults and in children on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis) in mice and at oral doses up to 400 mg/kg (resulting in approximately 140 times the exposure to drug plus metabolites from the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults and in children based on a comparison of the plasma AUC values) in rats.  The clinical significance of these findings for the long-term use of zafirlukast is unknown.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Zafirlukast showed no evidence of mutagenic potential in the reverse microbial assay, in 2 forward point mutation (CHO-HGPRT and mouse lymphoma) assays or in two assays for chromosomal aberrations (the <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> human peripheral blood lymphocyte clastogenic assay and the <content styleCode="italics">in vivo</content> rat bone marrow micronucleus assay).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>No evidence of impairment of fertility and reproduction was seen in male and female rats treated with zafirlukast at oral doses up to 2000 mg/kg (approximately 410 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis).</paragraph>

At an oral dose of 2000 mg/kg/day in rats, maternal toxicity and deaths were seen with increased incidence of early fetal resorption.  Spontaneous abortions occurred in cynomolgus monkeys at the maternally toxic oral dose of 2000 mg/kg/day.  There are no adequate and well-controlled trials in pregnant women.  Because animal reproductive studies are not always predictive of human response, zafirlukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</paragraph>

Following repeated 40 mg twice-a-day dosing in healthy women, average steady-state concentrations of zafirlukast in breast milk were 50 ng/mL compared to 255 ng/mL in plasma.  Because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for zafirlukast in mouse and rat studies and the enhanced sensitivity of neonatal rats and dogs to the adverse effects of zafirlukast, zafirlukast should not be administered to mothers who are breast-feeding.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>The effectiveness of zafirlukast for the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma in pediatric patients 5 through 11 years of age is based on an extrapolation of the demonstrated efficacy of zafirlukast in adults with asthma and the likelihood that the disease course, and pathophysiology and the drug's effect are substantially similar between the two populations.  The recommended dose for the patients 5 through 11 years of age is based upon a cross-study comparison of the pharmacokinetics of zafirlukast in adults and pediatric subjects, and on the safety profile of zafirlukast in both adult and pediatric patients at doses equal to or higher than the recommended dose.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The safety and effectiveness of zafirlukast for pediatric patients less than 5 years of age has not been established. The effect of zafirlukast on growth in children has not been determined.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>A total of 8094 patients were exposed to zafirlukast in North American and European short-term placebo-controlled clinical trials. Of these, 243 patients were elderly (age 65 years and older). No overall difference in adverse events was seen in the elderly patients, except for an increase in the frequency of infections among zafirlukast-treated elderly patients compared to placebo-treated elderly patients (7.0% vs. 2.9%).  The infections were not severe, occurred mostly in the lower respiratory tract, and did not necessitate withdrawal of therapy.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>An open-label, uncontrolled, 4-week trial of 3759 asthma patients compared the safety and efficacy of zafirlukast 20 mg given twice daily in three patient age groups, adolescents (12 to 17 years), adults (18 to 65 years), and elderly (greater than 65 years). A higher percentage of elderly patients (n=384) reported adverse events when compared to adults and adolescents.  These elderly patients showed less improvement in efficacy measures.  In the elderly patients, adverse events occurring in greater than 1% of the population included headache (4.7%), diarrhea and nausea (1.8%), and pharyngitis (1.3%).  The elderly reported the lowest percentage of infections of all three age groups in this study.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Rarely, elevations of one or more liver enzymes have occurred in patients receiving zafirlukast in controlled clinical trials. In clinical trials, most of these have been observed at doses four times higher than the recommended dose. The following hepatic events (which have occurred predominantly in females) have been reported from postmarketing adverse event surveillance of patients who have received the recommended dose of zafirlukast (40 mg/day):  cases of symptomatic hepatitis (with or without hyperbilirubinemia) without other attributable cause; and rarely, hyperbilirubinemia without other elevated liver function tests.  In most, but not all postmarketing reports, the patient's symptoms abated and the liver enzymes returned to normal or near normal after stopping zafirlukast.  In rare cases, patients have presented with fulminant hepatitis or progressed to hepatic failure, liver transplantation and death (see <content styleCode="bold">WARNINGS</content>, <content styleCode="bold">Hepatotoxicity</content> and <content styleCode="bold">PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients</content>)</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In clinical trials, an increased proportion of zafirlukast patients over the age of 55 years reported infections as compared to placebo-treated patients.  A similar finding was not observed in other age groups studied.  These infections were mostly mild or moderate in intensity and predominantly affected the respiratory tract.  Infections occurred equally in both sexes, were dose-proportional to total milligrams of zafirlukast exposure, and were associated with coadministration of inhaled corticosteroids.  The clinical significance of this finding is unknown.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In rare cases, patients with asthma on zafirlukast may present with systemic eosinophilia, eosinophilic pneumonia, or  clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg-Strauss syndrome, a condition which is often treated with systemic steroid therapy. Physicians should be alert to eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients.  These events have usually, but not always, been associated with reductions and/or withdrawal of steroid therapy.  The possibility that zafirlukast may be associated with emergence of Churg-Strauss syndrome can neither be excluded nor established (see <content styleCode="bold">PRECAUTIONS, Eosinophilic Conditions</content>).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Neuropsychiatric adverse events, including insomnia and depression, have been reported in association with zafirlukast therapy (see <content styleCode="bold">PRECAUTIONS, Neuropsychiatric Events</content>). Hypersensitivity reactions, including urticaria, angioedema and rashes, with or without blistering, have also been reported in association with zafirlukast therapy.  Additionally, there have been reports of patients experiencing agranulocytosis, bleeding, bruising, or edema, arthralgia, myalgia, malaise, and pruritus in association with zafirlukast therapy. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Rare cases of patients experiencing increased theophylline levels with or without clinical signs or symptoms of theophylline toxicity after the addition of zafirlukast to an existing theophylline regimen have been reported.  The mechanism of the interaction between zafirlukast and theophylline in these patients is unknown and not predicted by available <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> metabolism data and the results of two clinical drug interaction studies (see <content styleCode="bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</content> and <content styleCode="bold">PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions</content>).</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Zafirlukast has been evaluated for safety in 788 pediatric patients 5 through 11 years of age.  Cumulatively, 313 pediatric patients were treated with zafirlukast 10 mg twice daily or higher for at least 6 months, and 113 of them were treated for one year or longer in clinical trials. The safety profile of zafirlukast 10 mg twice daily-versus placebo in the 4- and 6-week double-blind trials was generally similar to that observed in the adult clinical trials with zafirlukast 20 mg twice daily.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In pediatric patients receiving zafirlukast in multi-dose clinical trials, the following events occurred with a frequency of ≥2% and more frequently than in pediatric patients who received placebo, regardless of causality assessment: headache (4.5 vs. 4.2%) and abdominal pain (2.8 vs. 2.3%).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The post-marketing experience in this age group is similar to that seen in adults, including hepatic dysfunction, which may lead to liver failure.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Overdosage with zafirlukast has been reported in four patients surviving reported doses as high as 200 mg. The predominant symptoms reported following zafirlukast overdose were rash and upset stomach.  There were no acute toxic effects in humans that could be consistently ascribed to the administration of zafirlukast.  It is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures in the event of an overdose; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required.</paragraph>
