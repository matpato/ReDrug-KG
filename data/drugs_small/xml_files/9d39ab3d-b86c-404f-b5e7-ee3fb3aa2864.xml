                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as meloxicam, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Laf217b92-a98f-4417-9b52-5d0644988a08">Warnings &amp; Precautions (5.2)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10-14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of MI and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#L19b8894f-314b-48f2-90ee-be501e56a33d">Contraindications (4)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>SYMBRAVO should not be given to patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of rizatriptan. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known coronary artery disease (CAD). 5-HT<sub>1</sub> agonists, including SYMBRAVO may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal‚Äôs Angina), even in patients without a history of CAD <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#L19b8894f-314b-48f2-90ee-be501e56a33d">Contraindications (4)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Triptan-na√Øve patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) should have a cardiovascular evaluation prior to receiving SYMBRAVO. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, SYMBRAVO should not be administered <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#L19b8894f-314b-48f2-90ee-be501e56a33d">Contraindications (4)</linkHtml>]</content>. For patients who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consideration should be given to administration of the first dose of SYMBRAVO in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following SYMBRAVO administration. Periodic cardiovascular evaluation should be considered in intermittent long-term users of SYMBRAVO who have cardiovascular risk factors.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Avoid the use of SYMBRAVO in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If SYMBRAVO is used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>NSAIDs, including meloxicam, a component of SYMBRAVO, can cause serious GI adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with meloxicam. Only 1 in 5 patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3-6 months, and in about 2-4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective SSRIs; smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT<sub>1</sub> agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT<sub>1</sub> agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, transient ischemic attack). Discontinue SYMBRAVO if a cerebrovascular event occurs.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed with migraine, and in patients with migraine who present with atypical symptoms, care should be taken to exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions.

                        <paragraph>Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>SYMBRAVO is not recommended in patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency and is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency who are at risk for renal failure due to volume depletion.</paragraph>

Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling. Other clinical manifestations may include hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis. Sometimes symptoms of DRESS may resemble an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its presentation, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident.

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, SYMBRAVO is contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#L19b8894f-314b-48f2-90ee-be501e56a33d">Contraindications (4</linkHtml>)]</content>. When SYMBRAVO is used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches, or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including SYMBRAVO particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors (MAOIs). Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms can occur within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. SYMBRAVO treatment should be discontinued if serotonin syndrome is suspected <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Lae7cd721-6198-4742-a944-d069b05f5511">Drug Interactions (7.1)</linkHtml>,<linkHtml href="#La1b0536e-a409-40e4-8251-1b296a31d509"> Patient Counseling Information (17)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Published studies and postmarketing reports describe maternal NSAID use at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy associated with fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. In many cases, but not all, the decrease in amniotic fluid was transient and reversible with cessation of the drug. There have been a limited number of case reports of maternal NSAID use and neonatal renal dysfunction without oligohydramnios, some of which were irreversible. Some cases of neonatal renal dysfunction required treatment with invasive procedures, such as exchange transfusion or dialysis.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Methodological limitations of these postmarketing studies and reports include lack of a control group; limited information regarding dose, duration, and timing of drug exposure; and concomitant use of other medications. These limitations preclude establishing a reliable estimate of the risk of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes with maternal NSAID use.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Because the published safety data on neonatal outcomes involved mostly preterm infants, the generalizability of certain reported risks to the full-term infant exposed to NSAIDs through maternal use is uncertain.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In a pregnancy registry for rizatriptan users, no pattern of congenital anomalies or other adverse birth outcomes was identified over the period of 1998 to 2018. However, the lack of identification of any pattern should be viewed with caution, as the number of prospective reports with outcome information was low and did not provide sufficient power to detect an increased risk of individual birth defects associated with the use of rizatriptan. Additionally, there was significant loss to follow-up in the prospective pregnancy reports, further complicating this assessment of an association between rizatriptan and any pattern of congenital anomalies or other adverse birth outcomes.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a study using data from the Swedish Medical Birth Register, live births to women who reported using triptans or ergots during pregnancy were compared with those of women who did not. Of the 157 births with first-trimester exposure to rizatriptan, 7 infants were born with malformations (relative risk 1.01 [95% CI: 0.40 to 2.08]). A study using linked data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway to the Norwegian Prescription Database compared pregnancy outcomes in women who redeemed prescriptions for triptans during pregnancy, as well as a migraine disease comparison group who redeemed prescriptions for triptans before pregnancy only, compared with a population control group. Of the 310 women who redeemed prescriptions for rizatriptan during the first trimester, 10 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.03 [95% CI: 0.55 to 1.93]), while for the 271 women who redeemed prescriptions for rizatriptan before, but not during, pregnancy, 12 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.48 [95% CI: 0.83 to 2.64]), each compared with the population comparison group.</paragraph>

The no effect level was 20 mg/kg/day (20-fold greater than the MRHD of 20 mg of meloxicam based on BSA conversion).

                        <paragraph>Oral administration of meloxicam to pregnant rats during late gestation through lactation increased the incidence of dystocia, delayed parturition, and decreased offspring survival at meloxicam doses of 0.125 mg/kg/day or greater (0.06 times the MRHD of 20 mg of meloxicam based on BSA comparison).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>When rizatriptan (0, 2, 10, or 100 mg/kg/day) was administered orally to pregnant rats throughout organogenesis, a decrease in fetal body weight was observed at the highest doses tested. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryofetal development was 10 mg/kg/day (10 times the MRHD of 10 mg of rizatriptan on a mg/m<sup>2 </sup>basis). When rizatriptan (0, 5, 10, or 50 mg/kg/day) was administered orally to pregnant rabbits throughout organogenesis, no adverse fetal effects were observed. The highest dose tested of 50 mg/kg/day was 97 times the MRHD of 10 mg of rizatriptan on a mg/m<sup>2 </sup>basis.

The no-effect dose (2 mg/kg/day) for adverse effects on postnatal development was 2 times the MRHD of 10 mg rizatriptan on a mg/m<sup>2 </sup>basis.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Oral administration of rizatriptan (0, 5, 100, or 250 mg/kg/day) throughout organogenesis and lactation resulted in neonatal mortality, reduced body weight (which persisted into adulthood), and impaired neurobehavioral function in offspring at all but the lowest dose tested. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on postnatal development (5 mg/kg/day) was 5 times the MRHD of 10 mg rizatriptan on a mg/m<sup>2 </sup>basis.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Symptoms following acute meloxicam overdoses have been typically limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, which have been generally reversible with supportive care. Gastrointestinal bleeding has occurred. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression and coma have occurred, but were rare <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Laf217b92-a98f-4417-9b52-5d0644988a08">Warnings and Precautions (5.2</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#Lf5f74955-e60d-456a-9393-8f1009c44837">5.9</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#Lef70a3dc-cf2b-48e0-9c8b-ec17d2eb1319">5.11</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#L1e575475-2134-4112-9d30-7c9565c3014c">5.15</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Manage patients with symptomatic and supportive care following a meloxicam overdosage. There are no specific antidotes. Consider emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 grams in adults, 1 to 2 grams per kg of body weight in pediatric patients) and/or osmotic cathartic in symptomatic patients seen within four hours of ingestion or in patients with a large overdosage (5 to 10 times the recommended dosage). Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may be employed but are not likely to be useful due to high protein binding.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>There is limited experience with meloxicam overdose. In four reported cases of meloxicam overdose, patients took 6- to 11-times the highest available oral dose of meloxicam tablets (15 mg); all recovered. Cholestyramine is known to accelerate the clearance of meloxicam. Accelerated removal of meloxicam by 4 g doses of cholestyramine given three times a day was demonstrated in a clinical trial. Administration of cholestyramine may be useful following an overdosage.</paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In a clinical pharmacology study in which 12 adult subjects received rizatriptan at total cumulative doses of 80 mg (given within four hours), two of the subjects experienced syncope, dizziness, bradycardia including third degree AV block, vomiting, and/or incontinence.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Based on the pharmacology of rizatriptan, hypertension or myocardial ischemia could occur after overdosage. Gastrointestinal decontamination, (i.e., gastric lavage followed by activated charcoal) should be considered in patients suspected of an overdose with rizatriptan. Clinical and electrocardiographic monitoring should be continued for at least 12 hours, even if clinical symptoms are not observed. The effects of hemo- or peritoneal dialysis on serum concentrations of rizatriptan are unknown.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>SYMBRAVO contains meloxicam and rizatriptan.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Meloxicam has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties. The mechanism of action of meloxicam, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Meloxicam is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro. Meloxicam concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because meloxicam is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Rizatriptan binds with high affinity to human cloned 5-HT<sub>1B/1D </sub>receptors. Rizatriptan presumably exerts its therapeutic effects in the treatment of migraine headache by binding to 5-HT<sub>1B/1D</sub> receptors located on intracranial blood vessels and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Meloxicam is extensively metabolized in the liver. Meloxicam metabolites include 5'-carboxy meloxicam (60% of dose), from cytochrome P450 (CYP) mediated metabolism formed by oxidation of an intermediate metabolite, 5'-hydroxymethyl meloxicam, which is also excreted to a lesser extent (9% of dose). <content styleCode="italics">In vitro</content> studies indicate that CYP2C9 plays an important role in this metabolic pathway with a minor contribution of the CYP3A4 isozyme.

                        <paragraph>The primary route of rizatriptan metabolism is via oxidative deamination by monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) to the indole acetic acid metabolite, which is not active at the 5-HT<sub>1B/1D</sub> receptor. N-monodesmethyl-rizatriptan, a metabolite with activity similar to that of the parent compound at the 5-HT<sub>1B/1D </sub>receptor, is formed to a minor degree. Plasma concentrations of N-monodesmethyl-rizatriptan are approximately 14% of those of parent compound, and it is eliminated at a similar rate.

The extent of the urinary excretion was confirmed for unlabeled multiple 7.5 mg doses: 0.5%, 6%, and 13% of the dose were found in urine in the form of meloxicam, and the 5'-hydroxymethyl and 5'-carboxy metabolites, respectively. There is significant biliary and/or enteral secretion of the drug. This was demonstrated when oral administration of cholestyramine following a single intravenous dose of meloxicam decreased the AUC of meloxicam by 50%. The mean elimination half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) ranges from 15 hours to 20 hours. Plasma clearance ranges from 7 to 9 mL/min.</paragraph>

                     <content styleCode="underline">Study 1: Efficacy Trial</content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The efficacy of SYMBRAVO for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults was demonstrated in one randomized, double-blind, controlled trial [Study 1 (<linkHtml href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT03896009">NCT03896009</linkHtml>)]. SYMBRAVO demonstrated an effect on headache pain freedom and most bothersome symptom (MBS) freedom at two hours after dosing, compared to placebo. Among patients who selected an MBS, the most commonly selected symptom was photophobia (61%), followed by nausea (20%), and phonophobia (19%).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In Study 1, 1,594 patients with a history of migraine with or without aura, according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3) diagnostic criteria, were randomized to receive either SYMBRAVO (N=456), 10 mg rizatriptan (N=456), 20 mg meloxicam (matching the formulation of the meloxicam used in SYMBRAVO) (N=455), or placebo (N=227). Patients were instructed to treat a migraine of moderate to severe pain intensity with a single dose of medication. Rescue medication (including triptans and NSAIDs) was allowed 2 hours after the initial treatment; however, ergots were not allowed within 24 hours before or after study drug administration, and opioids were not allowed for the duration of the study. Patients were 83% female and 17% male, predominantly White (77%), with a mean age of 41.2 years (range 18-67). Approximately 7% of patients were taking preventive medications for migraine at baseline.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The primary efficacy analyses were conducted in patients who treated a migraine with moderate to severe pain. Pain freedom was defined as a reduction of moderate or severe headache pain to no headache pain, and MBS freedom was defined as the absence of the self-identified MBS (i.e., photophobia, phonophobia, or nausea). The percentage of patients achieving headache pain freedom and MBS freedom 2 hours after a single dose was statistically significantly greater among patients who received SYMBRAVO compared to those who received placebo (Table¬†3).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The key secondary endpoint of percentage of patients who experienced sustained pain freedom up to 24 hours (pain free from 2 hours through 24 hours postdose without use of other medications) was statistically significantly greater among patients who received a single dose of SYMBRAVO (16.1%) compared to those who received meloxicam (9%; p=0.001), or rizatriptan (11%; p=0.038).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Additional secondary endpoints included pain relief (reduction in migraine pain intensity from moderate or severe to mild or no headache pain) and the ability to perform normal daily activities at 2 hours after dosing. The ability to perform normal daily activities at two hours after dosing was derived from a single item questionnaire, which asked patients to select one response on a 4-point scale; normal function, mild impairment, severe impairment, or required bedrest. A statistically significantly greater percentage of participants who received SYMBRAVO achieved pain relief at 2 hours after dosing and were able to perform normal daily activities at 2 hours after dosing when compared to placebo (Table¬†3).</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>In Study 2 (<linkHtml href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04163185">NCT04163185</linkHtml>), 302 patients with a history of migraine with or without aura, according to the ICHD-3 diagnostic criteria, were randomized to either SYMBRAVO (N=152) or placebo (N=150). Patients were instructed to treat a migraine when the initial pain was mild, with a single dose of medication. Rescue medication was allowed 2 hours after the initial treatment. Patients were 85.4% female and 14.6% male, predominantly White (83.1%), with a mean age of 41.5 years (range 19-65), and a mean BMI of 28.5 kg/m<sup>2 </sup>(range 17.2-39.9). Approximately 6.4% of patients were taking preventive medications for migraine at baseline.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph styleCode="C-BodyText">The primary efficacy analyses were conducted in patients who treated a migraine with initial pain that was mild. The percentage of patients achieving headache pain freedom and MBS freedom 2 hours after a single dose was statistically significantly greater among patients who received SYMBRAVO compared to those who received placebo (Table 4). Pain freedom at 2 hours was 32.6% in the SYMBRAVO treated group, compared to 16.3% in placebo (p=0.002). MBS freedom at 2 hours was 43.9% in the SYMBRAVO treated group, compared to 26.7% in the placebo group (p=0.003) (Table 4).</paragraph>
