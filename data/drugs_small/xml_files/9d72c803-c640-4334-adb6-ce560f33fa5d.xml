Patients can be seriously injured or injure others during complex sleep behaviors. Such injuries may result in a fatal outcome. Other complex sleep behaviors (e.g., preparing and eating food, making phone calls, or having sex) have also been reported. Patients usually do not remember these events.

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets are CNS depressant and can impair daytime function in some patients even when used as prescribed. Prescribers should monitor for excess depressant effects, but impairment can occur in the absence of subjective symptoms, and may not be reliably detected by ordinary clinical exam (i.e. less than formal psychomotor testing). While pharmacodynamic tolerance or adaptation to some adverse depressant effects of zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets may develop, patients using zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets should be cautioned against driving or engaging in other hazardous activities or activities requiring complete mental alertness the day after use.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Additive effects occur with concomitant use of other CNS depressants (e.g. benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, alcohol), including daytime use <content styleCode="italics">[see DRUG INTERACTIONS (<linkHtml href="#ID242">7.1</linkHtml>)].</content> Downward dose adjustment of zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets and concomitant CNS depressants should be considered <content styleCode="italics">[see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (<linkHtml href="#ID191">2.3</linkHtml>)]</content>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Because sleep disturbances may be the presenting manifestation of a physical and/or psychiatric disorder, symptomatic treatment of insomnia should be initiated only after a careful evaluation of the patient. The failure of insomnia to remit after 7 to 10 days of treatment may indicate the presence of a primary psychiatric and/or medical illness that should be evaluated. Worsening of insomnia or the emergence of new thinking or behavior abnormalities may be the consequence of an unrecognized psychiatric or physical disorder. Such findings have emerged during the course of treatment with sedative/hypnotic drugs, including zolpidem.</paragraph>

Since sedative-hypnotics have the capacity to depress respiratory drive, precautions should be taken if zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets are prescribed to patients with compromised respiratory function or concomitant use with opioids or other CNS depressants. Postmarketing reports of respiratory insufficiency in patients receiving 10 mg of zolpidem tartrate, most of whom had pre-existing respiratory impairment, have been reported.

Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigators involving related drug products and uses, since each group of drug trials is conducted under a different set of conditions. However, the cited figures provide the physician with a basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the incidence of side effects in the population studied.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Other treatment-emergent adverse reactions associated with participation in zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets studies (those reported at frequencies of &lt;1%) were not different in nature or frequency to those seen in studies with immediate-release zolpidem tartrate, which are listed below.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Immediate-release zolpidem tartrate was administered to 3,660 subjects in clinical trials throughout the U.S., Canada, and Europe. Treatment-emergent adverse events associated with clinical trial participation were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing treatment-emergent adverse events, similar types of untoward events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized event categories and classified utilizing a modified World Health Organization (WHO) dictionary of preferred terms.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The frequencies presented, therefore, represent the proportions of the 3,660 individuals exposed to zolpidem, at all doses, who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving zolpidem. All reported treatment-emergent adverse events are included, except those already listed in the table above of adverse events in placebo-controlled studies, those coding terms that are so general as to be uninformative, and those events where a drug cause was remote. It is important to emphasize that, although the events reported did occur during treatment with AMBIEN, they were not necessarily caused by it.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Adverse events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in greater than 1/100 subjects; infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients; rare events are those occurring in less than 1/1,000 patients.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Abuse is characterized by misuse of the drug for non-medical purposes, often in combination with other psychoactive substances. Tolerance is a state of adaptation in which exposure to a drug induces changes that result in a diminution of one or more of the drug effects over time. Tolerance may occur to both desired and undesired effects of drugs and may develop at different rates for different effects.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Addiction is a primary, chronic, neurobiological disease with genetic, psychosocial, and environmental factors influencing its development and manifestations. It is characterized by behaviors that include one or more of the following: impaired control over drug use, compulsive use, continued use despite harm, and craving. Drug addiction is a treatable disease, using a multidisciplinary approach, but relapse is common.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Studies of abuse potential in former drug abusers found that the effects of single doses of zolpidem tartrate 40 mg were similar, but not identical, to diazepam 20 mg, while zolpidem tartrate 10 mg effects were difficult to distinguish from placebo.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Because persons with a history of addiction to, or abuse of, drugs or alcohol are at increased risk for misuse, abuse and addiction of zolpidem, they should be monitored carefully when receiving zolpidem or any other hypnotic.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Use of zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets may lead to development of physical and/or psychological dependence. This risk of dependence increases with dose and duration of treatment. The risk of abuse and dependence is also greater in patients with history of alcohol or drug abuse. Zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets should be used with extreme caution in patients with current or past alcohol or drug abuse.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Physical dependence is a state of adaptation that is manifested by a specific withdrawal syndrome that can be produced by abrupt cessation, rapid dose reduction, decreasing blood level of the drug, and/or administration of an antagonist.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Sedative/hypnotics have produced withdrawal signs and symptoms following abrupt discontinuation. These reported symptoms range from mild dysphoria and insomnia to a withdrawal syndrome that may include abdominal and muscle cramps, vomiting, sweating, tremors, convulsions, and delirium. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The following adverse events, which are considered to meet the DSM-III-R criteria for uncomplicated sedative/hypnotic withdrawal, were reported during zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets clinical trials following placebo substitution occurring within 48 hours following last zolpidem treatment: fatigue, nausea, flushing, lightheadedness, uncontrolled crying, emesis, stomach cramps, panic attack, nervousness, and abdominal discomfort. These reported adverse events occurred at an incidence of 1% or less. However, available data cannot provide a reliable estimate of the incidence, if any, of dependence during treatment at recommended doses. There have been postmarketing reports of abuse, dependence and withdrawal with zolpidem.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>General symptomatic and supportive measures should be used along with immediate gastric lavage where appropriate. Intravenous fluids should be administered as needed. Zolpidem's sedative hypnotic effect was shown to be reduced by flumazenil and therefore may be useful; however, flumazenil administration may contribute to the appearance of neurological symptoms (convulsions). As in all cases of drug overdose, respiration, pulse, blood pressure, and other appropriate signs should be monitored and general supportive measures employed. Hypotension and CNS depression should be monitored and treated by appropriate medical intervention. Sedating drugs should be withheld following zolpidem overdosage, even if excitation occurs. The value of dialysis in the treatment of overdosage has not been determined, although hemodialysis studies in patients with renal failure receiving therapeutic doses have demonstrated that zolpidem is not dialyzable.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>As with the management of all overdosage, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered. The physician may wish to consider contacting a poison control center for up-to-date information on the management of hypnotic drug product overdosage.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Zolpidem is a GABA A receptor positive modulator presumed to exert its therapeutic effects in the short-term treatment of insomnia through binding to the benzodiazepine site of α1 subunit containing GABA A receptors, increasing the frequency of chloride channel opening resulting in the inhibition of neuronal excitation.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Zolpidem binds to GABA A receptors with greater affinity for α1 subunit relative to α2 and α3 subunit containing receptors. Zolpidem has no appreciable binding affinity for α5 subunit containing GABA A receptors. This binding profile may explain the relative absence of myorelaxant effects in animal studies. Zolpidem has no appreciable binding affinity for dopaminergic D2, serotonergic 5HT<sub>2</sub>, adrenergic, histaminergic or muscarinic receptors.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets exhibits biphasic absorption characteristics, which results in rapid initial absorption from the gastrointestinal tract similar to zolpidem tartrate immediate-release, then provides extended plasma concentrations beyond three hours after administration. A study in 24 healthy male subjects was conducted to compare mean zolpidem plasma concentration-time profiles obtained after single oral administration of zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets 12.5 mg and of an immediate-release formulation of zolpidem tartrate (10 mg). The terminal elimination half-life observed with zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets (12.5 mg) were similar to that obtained with immediate-release zolpidem tartrate (10 mg). The mean plasma concentration-time profiles are shown in Figure 1. </paragraph>

The mean AUC of zolpidem was 740 ng·hr/mL (range: 295 to 1359 ng·hr/mL).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A food-effect study in 45 healthy subjects compared the pharmacokinetics of zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets 12.5 mg when administered while fasting or within 30 minutes after a meal. Results demonstrated that with food, mean AUC and C<sub>max</sub> were decreased by 23% and 30%, respectively, while median T<sub>max</sub> was increased from 2 hours to 4 hours. The half-life was not changed. These results suggest that, for faster sleep onset, zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets should not be administered with or immediately after a meal.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets were not studied in patients with hepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics of an immediate-release formulation of zolpidem tartrate in eight patients with chronic hepatic insufficiency was compared to results in healthy subjects. Following a single 20-mg oral zolpidem tartrate dose, mean C<sub>max</sub> and AUC were found to be two times (250 vs. 499 ng/mL) and five times (788 vs. 4,203 ng·hr/mL) higher, respectively, in hepatically compromised patients. T<sub>max</sub> did not change. The mean half-life in cirrhotic patients of 9.9 hr (range: 4.1 to 25.8 hr) was greater than that observed in normal subjects of 2.2 hr (range: 1.6 to 2.4 hr) [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2), WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.8), USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.7)].</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets were not studied in patients with renal impairment. The pharmacokinetics of an immediate-release formulation of zolpidem tartrate were studied in 11 patients with end-stage renal failure (mean Cl<sub>Cr</sub> = 6.5 ± 1.5 mL/min) undergoing hemodialysis three times a week, who were dosed with zolpidem tartrate 10 mg orally each day for 14 or 21 days. No statistically significant differences were observed for C<sub>max</sub>, T<sub>max</sub>, half-life, and AUC between the first and last day of drug administration when baseline concentration adjustments were made. Zolpidem was not hemodialyzable. No accumulation of unchanged drug appeared after 14 or 21 days. Zolpidem pharmacokinetics was not significantly different in renally impaired patients. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with compromised renal function. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets were evaluated in three placebo-controlled studies for the treatment of patients with chronic primary insomnia (as defined in the APA Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, DSM IV<sup>TM</sup>).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Adult outpatients (18 to 64 years) with primary insomnia (N=212) were evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, 3-week trial comparing zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets 12.5 mg and placebo. Zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets 12.5 mg decreased wake time after sleep onset (WASO) for the first 7 hours during the first 2 nights and for the first 5 hours after 2 weeks of treatment. Zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets 12.5 mg were superior to placebo on objective measures (polysomnography recordings) of sleep induction (by decreasing latency to persistent sleep [LPS]) during the first 2 nights of treatment and after 2 weeks of treatment. Zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets 12.5 mg were also superior to placebo on the patient reported global impression regarding the aid to sleep after the first 2 nights and after 3 weeks of treatment.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Elderly outpatients (≥ 65 years) with primary insomnia (N=205) were evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, 3-week trial comparing zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets 6.25 mg and placebo. Zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets 6.25 mg decreased wake time after sleep onset (WASO) for the first 6 hours during the first 2 nights and the first 4 hours after 2 weeks of treatment. Zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets 6.25 mg were superior to placebo on objective measures (polysomnography recordings) of sleep induction (by decreasing LPS) during the first 2 nights of treatment and after 2 weeks on treatment. Zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets 6.25 mg were superior to placebo on the patient reported global impression regarding the aid to sleep after the first 2 nights and after 3 weeks of treatment.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In both studies, in patients treated with zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets, polysomnography showed increased wakefulness at the end of the night compared to placebo-treated patients.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a 24-week double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized study in adult outpatients (18 to 64 years) with primary insomnia (N=1025), zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets 12.5 mg administered as needed (3 to 7 nights per week) was superior to placebo over 24 weeks, on patient global impression regarding aid to sleep, and on patient-reported specific sleep parameters for sleep induction and sleep maintenance with no significant increased frequency of drug intake observed over time.</paragraph>

In these studies, no significant decrease in performance was observed eight hours after a nighttime dose. In addition, no evidence of next-day residual effects was detected with zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets 12.5 mg and 6.25 mg using self-ratings of sedation.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>During the 3-week studies, next-day somnolence was reported by 15% of the adult patients who received 12.5 mg zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets versus 2% of the placebo group; next-day somnolence was reported by 6% of the elderly patients who received 6.25 mg zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets versus 5% of the placebo group [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (<linkHtml href="#ID224">6</linkHtml>)]. In a 6-month study, the overall incidence of next-day somnolence was 5.7% in the zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets group as compared to 2% in the placebo group.</paragraph>

In the two 3-week placebo-controlled studies in patients with primary insomnia, a rebound effect was only observed on the first night after abrupt discontinuation of zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets. On the second night, there was no worsening compared to baseline in the zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets group.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a 6-month placebo-controlled study in which zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets were taken as needed (3 to 7 nights per week), within the first month a rebound effect was observed for Total Sleep Time (not for WASO) during the first night off medication. After this first month period, no further rebound insomnia was observed. After final treatment discontinuation no rebound was observed.</paragraph>
