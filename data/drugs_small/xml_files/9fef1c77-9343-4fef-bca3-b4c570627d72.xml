                           <item>PYZCHIVA is intended for use under the guidance and supervision of a healthcare provider. PYZCHIVA should only be administered to patients who will be closely monitored and have regular follow-up visits with a healthcare provider. The appropriate dose should be determined by a healthcare provider using the patient's current weight at the time of dosing. In pediatric patients, it is recommended that PYZCHIVA be administered by a healthcare provider. If a healthcare provider determines that it is appropriate, a patient may self-inject or a caregiver may inject PYZCHIVA after proper training in subcutaneous injection technique. Instruct patients to follow the directions provided in the Medication Guide <content styleCode="italics">[see Medication Guide]</content>.</item>
                           <item>It is recommended that each injection be administered at a different anatomic location (such as upper arms, gluteal regions, thighs, or any quadrant of abdomen) than the previous injection, and not into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, erythematous, or indurated.Â When using the single-dose vial, a 1 mL syringe with a 27 gauge, Â½ inch needle is recommended.</item>
                           <item>Prior to administration, visually inspect PYZCHIVA for particulate matter and discoloration. PYZCHIVA is a clear, colorless to light yellow, sterile and preservative-free solution. Do not use PYZCHIVA if it is discolored or cloudy, or if other particulate matter is present. PYZCHIVA does not contain preservatives; therefore, discard any unused product remaining in the vial and/or syringe.</item>

Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of ustekinumab or of other ustekinumab products.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Approximately 6 to 12.4% of subjects treated with ustekinumab in plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis clinical trials developed antibodies to ustekinumab, which were generally low-titer. In plaque psoriasis clinical trials, antibodies to ustekinumab were associated with reduced or undetectable serum ustekinumab concentrations and reduced efficacy. In plaque psoriasis trials, the majority of subjects who were positive for antibodies to ustekinumab had neutralizing antibodies.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis clinical trials, 2.9% and 4.6% of subjects, respectively, developed antibodies to ustekinumab when treated with ustekinumab for approximately one year. No apparent association between the development of antibodies to ustekinumab and the development of injection site reactions was seen.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The formation of CYP450 enzymes can be suppressed by increased levels of certain cytokines (e.g., IL-1, IL-6, TNFÎ±, IFN) during chronic inflammation. Thus, use of ustekinumab products, antagonists of IL-12 and IL-23, could normalize the formation of CYP450 enzymes. Upon initiation or discontinuation of PYZCHIVA in patients who are receiving concomitant CYP450 substrates, particularly those with a narrow therapeutic index, consider monitoring for therapeutic effect or drug concentration and adjust the individual dosage of the CYP substrate as needed.Â See the prescribing information of specific CYP substrates.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Ustekinumab products have not been evaluated in patients who have undergone allergy immunotherapy. Ustekinumab products may decrease the protective effect of allergen immunotherapy (decrease tolerance) which may increase the risk of an allergic reaction to a dose of allergen immunotherapy. Therefore, caution should be exercised in patients receiving or who have received allergen immunotherapy, particularly for anaphylaxis.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Limited data from observational studies, published case reports, and postmarketing surveillance on the use of ustekinumab products during pregnancy are insufficient to inform a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, and other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Transport of human IgG antibody across the placenta increases as pregnancy progresses and peaks during the third trimester; therefore, ustekinumab products may be transferred to the developing fetus (<content styleCode="italics">seeÂ </content>
                           <content styleCode="italics">Clinical Considerations</content>). In animal reproductive and developmental toxicity studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed in offspring after administration of ustekinumab to pregnant monkeys at exposures greater than 100 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population(s) are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage of clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Because ustekinumab products may theoretically interfere with immune response to infections, consider risks and benefits prior to administering live vaccines to infants exposed to PYZCHIVA in utero. There are insufficient data regarding exposed infant serum levels of ustekinumab products at birth and the duration of persistence of ustekinumab products in infant serum after birth. Although a specific timeframe to delay administration of live attenuated vaccines in infants exposed in utero is unknown, consider the risks and benefits of delaying a minimum of 6 months after birth because of the clearance of the product.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Ustekinumab was tested in two embryo-fetal development toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys. No teratogenic or other adverse developmental effects were observed in fetuses from pregnant monkeys that were administered ustekinumab subcutaneously twice weekly or intravenously weekly during the period of organogenesis. Serum concentrations of ustekinumab in pregnant monkeys were greater than 100 times the serum concentration in patients treated subcutaneously with 90 mg of ustekinumab weekly for 4 weeks.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a combined embryo-fetal development and pre- and post-natal development toxicity study, pregnant cynomolgus monkeys were administered subcutaneous doses of ustekinumab twice weekly at exposures greater than 100 times the MRHD from the beginning of organogenesis to Day 33 after delivery. Neonatal deaths occurred in the offspring of one monkey administered ustekinumab at 22.5 mg/kg and one monkey dosed at 45 mg/kg. No ustekinumab-related effects on functional, morphological, or immunological development were observed in the neonates from birth through six months of age.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Ustekinumab products are human IgG1Îº monoclonal antibodies that bind with specificity to the p40 protein subunit used by both the IL-12 and IL-23 cytokines. IL-12 and IL-23 are naturally occurring cytokines that are involved in inflammatory and immune responses, such as natural killer cell activation and CD4+ T-cell differentiation and activation. In in vitro models, ustekinumab products were shown to disrupt IL-12 and IL-23 mediated signaling and cytokine cascades by disrupting the interaction of these cytokines with a shared cell- surface receptor chain, IL-12RÎ²1. The cytokines IL-12 and IL-23 have been implicated as important contributors to the chronic inflammation that is a hallmark of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. In animal models of colitis, genetic absence or antibody blockade of the p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23, the target of ustekinumab products, was shown to be protective.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In adult subjects with plaque psoriasis, the median time to reach the maximum serum concentration (T<sub>max</sub>) was 13.5 days and 7 days, respectively, after a single subcutaneous administration of 45 mg (N=22) and 90 mg (N=24) of ustekinumab. In healthy subjects (N=30), the median T<sub>max</sub> value (8.5 days) following a single subcutaneous administration of 90 mg of ustekinumab was comparable to that observed in subjects with plaque psoriasis.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Following multiple subcutaneous doses of ustekinumab in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis, steady-state serum concentrations of ustekinumab were achieved by Week 28. The mean (Â±SD) steady-state trough serum ustekinumab concentrations were 0.69 Â± 0.69 mcg/mL for subjects less than or equal to 100 kg receiving a 45 mg dose and 0.74 Â± 0.78 mcg/mL for subjects greater than 100 kg receiving a 90 mg dose. There was no apparent accumulation in serum ustekinumab concentration over time when given subcutaneously every 12 weeks.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Following the recommended intravenous induction dose, mean Â±SD peak serum ustekinumab concentration was 125.2 Â± 33.6 mcg/mL in subjects with Crohn's disease, and 129.1 Â± 27.6 mcg/mL in subjects with ulcerative colitis. Starting at Week 8, the recommended subcutaneous maintenance dosing of 90 mg ustekinumab was administered every 8 weeks. Steady state ustekinumab concentration was achieved by the start of the second maintenance dose. There was no apparent accumulation in ustekinumab concentration over time when given subcutaneously every 8 weeks. Mean Â± SD steady-state trough concentration was 2.5 Â± 2.1 mcg/mL in subjects with Crohn's disease, and 3.3 Â± 2.3 mcg/mL in subjects with ulcerative colitis for 90 mg ustekinumab administered every 8 weeks.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The mean (Â±SD) half-life ranged from 14.9 Â± 4.6 to 45.6 Â± 80.2 days across all plaque psoriasis trials following subcutaneous administration. Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed that the clearance of ustekinumab was 0.19 L/day (95% CI: 0.185, 0.197) in subjects with Crohn's disease and 0.19 L/day (95% CI: 0.179, 0.192) in subjects with ulcerative colitis with an estimated median terminal half-life of approximately 19 days for both IBD (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) populations.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>These results indicate the pharmacokinetics of ustekinumab were similar between subjects with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Animal studies have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential of ustekinumab products. Published literature showed that administration of murine IL-12 caused an anti-tumor effect in mice that contained transplanted tumors and IL-12/IL- 23p40 knockout mice or mice treated with anti-IL-12/IL-23p40 antibody had decreased host defense to tumors. Mice genetically manipulated to be deficient in both IL-12 and IL- 23 or IL-12 alone developed UV-induced skin cancers earlier and more frequently compared to wild-type mice. The relevance of these experimental findings in mouse models for malignancy risk in humans is unknown.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>No effects on fertility were observed in male cynomolgus monkeys that were administered ustekinumab at subcutaneous doses up to 45 mg/kg twice weekly (45 times the MRHD on a mg/kg basis) prior to and during the mating period. However, fertility and pregnancy outcomes were not evaluated in mated females.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>No effects on fertility were observed in female mice that were administered an analogous IL-12/IL-23p40 antibody by subcutaneous administration at doses up to 50 mg/kg, twice weekly, prior to and during early pregnancy.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (Ps STUDY 1 and Ps STUDY 2) enrolled a total of 1996 subjects 18 years of age and older with plaque psoriasis who had a minimum body surface area involvement of 10%, and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score â¥12, and who were candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy. Subjects with guttate, erythrodermic, or pustular psoriasis were excluded from the trials.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Ps STUDY 1 enrolled 766 subjects and Ps STUDY 2 enrolled 1230 subjects. The trials had the same design through Week 28. In both trials, subjects were randomized in equal proportion to placebo, 45 mg or 90 mg of ustekinumab. Subjects randomized to ustekinumab received 45 mg or 90 mg doses, regardless of weight, at Weeks 0, 4, and 16. Subjects randomized to receive placebo at Weeks 0 and 4 crossed over to receive ustekinumab (either 45 mg or 90 mg) at Weeks 12 and 16.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In both trials, subjects in all treatment groups had a median baseline PASI score ranging from approximately 17 to 18. Baseline PGA score was marked or severe in 44% of subjects in Ps STUDY 1 and 40% of subjects in Ps STUDY 2. Approximately two-thirds of all subjects had received prior phototherapy, 69% had received either prior conventional systemic or biologic therapy for the treatment of psoriasis, with 56% receiving prior conventional systemic therapy and 43% receiving prior biologic therapy. A total of 28% of subjects had a history of psoriatic arthritis.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In both trials, the endpoints were the proportion of subjects who achieved at least a 75% reduction in PASI score (PASI 75) from baseline to Week 12 and treatment success (cleared or minimal) on the Physician's Global Assessment (PGA). The PGA is a 6- category scale ranging from 0 (cleared) to 5 (severe) that indicates the physician's overall assessment of psoriasis focusing on plaque thickness/induration, erythema, and scaling.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>A multicenter, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial (Ps STUDY 3) enrolled 110 pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years of age with a minimum BSA involvement of 10%, a PASI score greater than or equal to 12, and a PGA score greater than or equal to 3, who were candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy and whose disease was inadequately controlled by topical therapy.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Subjects were randomized to receive placebo (n = 37), the recommended dose of ustekinumab (n = 36), or one-half the recommended dose of ustekinumab (n = 37) by subcutaneous injection at Weeks 0 and 4 followed by dosing every 12 weeks (q12w). The recommended dose of ustekinumab was 0.75 mg/kg for subjects weighing less than 60 kg, 45 mg for subjects weighing 60 kg to 100 kg, and 90 mg for subjects weighing greater than 100 kg. At Week 12, subjects who received placebo were crossed over to receive ustekinumab at the recommended dose or one-half the recommended dose.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Of the pediatric subjects, approximately 63% had prior exposure to phototherapy or conventional systemic therapy and approximately 11% had prior exposure to biologics.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The endpoints were the proportion of subjects who achieved a PGA score of cleared (0) or minimal (1), PASI 75, and PASI 90 at Week 12. Subjects were followed for up to 60 weeks following first administration of trial agent.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The safety and efficacy of ustekinumab was assessed in 927 subjects (PsA STUDY 1, n=615; PsA STUDY 2, n=312), in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adult subjects 18 years of age and older with active PsA (â¥5 swollen joints and â¥5 tender joints) despite nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) or disease modifying antirheumatic (DMARD) therapy. Subjects in these trials had a diagnosis of PsA for at least 6 months. Subjects with each subtype of PsA were enrolled, including polyarticular arthritis with the absence of rheumatoid nodules (39%), spondylitis with peripheral arthritis (28%), asymmetric peripheral arthritis (21%), distal interphalangeal involvement (12%) and arthritis mutilans (0.5%). Over 70% and 40% of the subjects, respectively, had enthesitis and dactylitis at baseline.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Subjects were randomized to receive treatment with ustekinumab 45 mg, 90 mg, or placebo subcutaneously at Weeks 0 and 4 followed by every 12 weeks (q12w) dosing. Approximately 50% of subjects continued on stable doses of MTX (â¤25 mg/week). The primary endpoint was the percentage of subjects achieving ACR 20 response at Week 24.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In PsA STUDY 1 and PsA STUDY 2, 80% and 86% of the subjects, respectively, had been previously treated with DMARDs. In PsA STUDY 1, previous treatment with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î±Â agent was not allowed. In PsA STUDY 2, 58% (n=180) of the subjects had been previously treated with TNF blocker, of whom over 70% had discontinued their TNF blocker treatment for lack of efficacy or intolerance at any time.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In both trials, a greater proportion of subjects achieved ACR 20, ACR 50 and PASI 75 response in the ustekinumab 45 mg and 90 mg groups compared to placebo at Week 24 (see Table 11). ACR 70 responses were also higher in the ustekinumab 45 mg and 90 mg groups, although the difference was only numerical (p=NS) in STUDY 2. Responses were consistent in subjects treated with ustekinumab alone or in combination with methotrexate. Responses were similar in subjects regardless of prior TNFÎ± exposure.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Ustekinumab was evaluated in three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in adult subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (Crohn's Disease Activity Index [CDAI] score of 220 to 450). There were two 8-week intravenous induction trials (CD-1 and CD-2) followed by a 44-week subcutaneous randomized withdrawal maintenance trial (CD-3) representing 52 weeks of therapy. Subjects in CD- 1 had failed or were intolerant to treatment with one or more TNF blockers, while subjects in CD-2 had failed or were intolerant to treatment with immunomodulators or corticosteroids, but never failed treatment with a TNF blocker.</paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="underline">Trials CD-1 and CD-2</content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In trials CD-1 and CD-2, 1409 subjects were randomized, of whom 1368 (CD-1, n=741; CD-2, n=627) were included in the final efficacy analysis. Induction of clinical response (defined as a reduction in CDAI score of greater than or equal to 100 points or CDAI score of less than 150) at Week 6 and clinical remission (defined as a CDAI score of less than 150) at Week 8 were evaluated. In both trials, subjects were randomized to receive a single intravenous administration of ustekinumab at either approximately 6 mg/kg, placebo (see Table 4), or 130 mg (a lower dose than recommended).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In trial CD-1, subjects had failed or were intolerant to prior treatment with a TNF blocker: 29% subjects had an inadequate initial response (primary non-responders), 69% responded but subsequently lost response (secondary non-responders) and 36% were intolerant to a TNF blocker. Of these subjects, 48% failed or were intolerant to one TNF blocker and 52% had failed 2 or 3 prior TNF blockers. At baseline and throughout the trial, approximately 46% of the subjects were receiving corticosteroids and 31% of the subjects were receiving immunomodulators (AZA, 6-MP, MTX). The median baseline CDAI score was 319 in the ustekinumab approximately 6 mg/kg group and 313 in the placebo group.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In trial CD-2, subjects had failed or were intolerant to prior treatment with corticosteroids (81% of subjects), at least one immunomodulator (6-MP, AZA, MTX; 68% of subjects), or both (49% of subjects). Additionally, 69% never received a TNF blocker and 31% previously received but had not failed a TNF blocker. At baseline, and throughout the trial, approximately 39% of the subjects were receiving corticosteroids and 35% of the subjects were receiving immunomodulators (AZA, 6-MP, MTX). The median baseline CDAI score was 286 in the ustekinumab and 290 in the placebo group.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In these induction trials, a greater proportion of subjects treated with ustekinumab (at the recommended dose of approximately 6 mg/kg dose) achieved clinical response at Week 6 and clinical remission at Week 8 compared to placebo (see Table 13 for clinical response and remission rates). Clinical response and remission were significant as early as Week 3 in ustekinumab-treated subjects and continued to improve through Week 8.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Ustekinumab was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials [UC-1 and UC-2 (<linkHtml href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT02407236">NCT02407236</linkHtml>)] in adult subjects with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who had an inadequate response to or failed to tolerate a biologic (i.e., TNF blocker and/or vedolizumab), corticosteroids, and/or 6-MP or AZA therapy. The 8-week intravenous induction trial (UC-1) was followed by the 44-week subcutaneous randomized withdrawal maintenance trial (UC-2) for a total of 52 weeks of therapy.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Disease assessment was based on the Mayo score, which ranged from 0 to 12 and has four subscores that were each scored from 0 (normal) to 3 (most severe): stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings on centrally-reviewed endoscopy, and physician global assessment. Moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis was defined at baseline (Week 0) as Mayo score of 6 to 12, including a Mayo endoscopy subscore â¥2. An endoscopy score of 2 was defined by marked erythema, absent vascular pattern, friability, erosions; and a score of 3 was defined by spontaneous bleeding, ulceration. At baseline, subjects had a median Mayo score of 9, with 84% of subjects having moderate disease (Mayo score 6-10) and 15% having severe disease (Mayo score 11-12).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Subjects in these trials may have received other concomitant therapies including aminosalicylates, immunomodulatory agents (AZA, 6-MP, or MTX), and oral corticosteroids (prednisone).</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In UC-1, 961 subjects were randomized at Week 0 to a single intravenous administration of ustekinumab of approximately 6 mg/kg, 130 mg (a lower dose than recommended), or placebo. Subjects enrolled in UC-1 had to have failed therapy with corticosteroids, immunomodulators or at least one biologic. A total of 51% had failed at least one biologic and 17% had failed both a TNF blocker and an integrin receptor blocker. Of the total population, 46% had failed corticosteroids or immunomodulators but were biologic-naÃ¯ve and an additional 3% had previously received but had not failed a biologic. At induction baseline and throughout the trial, approximately 52% subjects were receiving oral corticosteroids, 28% subjects were receiving immunomodulators (AZA, 6-MP, or MTX) and 69% subjects were receiving aminosalicylates.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The primary endpoint was clinical remission at Week 8. Clinical remission with a definition of: Mayo stool frequency subscore of 0 or 1, Mayo rectal bleeding subscore of 0 (no rectal bleeding), and Mayo endoscopy subscore of 0 or 1 (Mayo endoscopy subscore of 0 defined as normal or inactive disease and Mayo subscore of 1 defined as presence of erythema, decreased vascular pattern and no friability) is provided in Table 15.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The secondary endpoints were clinical response, endoscopic improvement, and histologic-endoscopic mucosal improvement. Clinical response with a definition of (â¥2 points and â¥30% decrease in modified Mayo score, defined as 3-component Mayo score without the Physician's Global Assessment, with either a decrease from baseline in the rectal bleeding subscore â¥1 or a rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1), endoscopic improvement with a definition of Mayo endoscopy subscore of 0 or 1, and histologic- endoscopic mucosal improvement with a definition of combined endoscopic improvement and histologic improvement of the colon tissue [neutrophil infiltration in &lt;5% of crypts, no crypt destruction, and no erosions, ulcerations, or granulation tissue]) are provided in Table 15.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In UC-1, a significantly greater proportion of subjects treated with ustekinumab (at the recommended dose of approximately 6 mg/kg dose) were in clinical remission and response and achieved endoscopic improvement and histologic-endoscopic mucosal improvement compared to placebo (see Table 15).</paragraph>
