The incidence of these rashes, which have included Stevens-Johnson syndrome, is approximately 0.8% (8 per 1,000) in pediatric patients (aged 2 to 16 years) receiving immediate-release lamotrigine as adjunctive therapy for epilepsy and 0.3% (3 per 1,000) in adults on adjunctive therapy for epilepsy. In a prospectively followed cohort of 1,983 pediatric patients (aged 2 to 16 years) with epilepsy taking adjunctive immediate-release lamotrigine, there was 1 rash-related death. </content>

Accordingly, lamotrigine extended-release should ordinarily be discontinued at the first sign of rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug related.

                     <title>2.1 General Dosing Considerations</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>
                           <content styleCode="underline">Rash</content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There are suggestions, yet to be proven, that the risk of severe, potentially life-threatening rash may be increased by (1) co-administration of lamotrigine extended-release tablets with valproate, (2) exceeding the recommended initial dose of lamotrigine extended-release tablets, or (3) exceeding the recommended dose escalation for lamotrigine extended-release tablets. However, cases have occurred in the absence of these factors <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#LINK_d39a4ddc-6a0c-4411-8896-9aaf0e18f1e4">Boxed Warning</linkHtml>]</content>. Therefore, it is important that the dosing recommendations be followed closely. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The risk of nonserious rash may be increased when the recommended initial dose and/or the rate of dose escalation for lamotrigine extended-release tablets are exceeded and in patients with a history of allergy or rash to other AEDs. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>It is recommended that lamotrigine extended-release tablets not be restarted in patients who discontinued due to rash associated with prior treatment with lamotrigine unless the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks. If the decision is made to restart a patient who has discontinued lamotrigine extended-release tablets, the need to restart with the initial dosing recommendations should be assessed. The greater the interval of time since the previous dose, the greater consideration should be given to restarting with the initial dosing recommendations. If a patient has discontinued lamotrigine for a period of more than 5 half-lives, it is recommended that initial dosing recommendations and guidelines be followed. The half-life of lamotrigine is affected by other concomitant medications <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#LINK_17fd4dd2-0529-477b-907a-3a9739448100">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</linkHtml>]</content>. </paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Because lamotrigine is metabolized predominantly by glucuronic acid conjugation, drugs that are known to induce or inhibit glucuronidation may affect the apparent clearance of lamotrigine. Drugs that induce glucuronidation include carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, rifampin, estrogen-containing products, including oral contraceptives, and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir. Valproate inhibits glucuronidation. For dosing considerations for lamotrigine extended-release tablets in patients on estrogen-containing products including contraceptives and atazanavir/ritonavir, see below and Table 5. For dosing considerations for lamotrigine extended-release tablets in patients on other drugs known to induce or inhibit glucuronidation, see Table 1 and Table 5.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>A therapeutic plasma concentration range has not been established for lamotrigine. Dosing of lamotrigine extended-release tablets should be based on therapeutic response <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#LINK_17fd4dd2-0529-477b-907a-3a9739448100">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>

Therefore, dose escalation should follow the recommended guidelines for initiating adjunctive therapy with lamotrigine extended-release tablets based on the concomitant AED or other concomitant medications (see Table 1). See below for adjustments to maintenance doses of lamotrigine extended-release tablets in women taking estrogen-containing oral contraceptives. </paragraph>

The dose increases should begin at the same time that the oral contraceptive is introduced and continue, based on clinical response, no more rapidly than 50 to 100 mg/day every week. Dose increases should not exceed the recommended rate (see Table 1) unless lamotrigine plasma levels or clinical response support larger increases. Gradual transient increases in lamotrigine plasma levels may occur during the week of inactive hormonal preparation (pill-free week), and these increases will be greater if dose increases are made in the days before or during the week of inactive hormonal preparation. Increased lamotrigine plasma levels could result in additional adverse reactions, such as dizziness, ataxia and diplopia. If adverse reactions attributable to lamotrigine extended-release tablets consistently occur during the pill-free week, dose adjustments to the overall maintenance dose may be necessary. Dose adjustments limited to the pill-free week are not recommended. For women taking lamotrigine extended-release tablets in addition to carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation, no adjustment to the dose of lamotrigine extended-release tablets should be necessary <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#LINK_9888622d-b12e-4eb2-a123-bfcf93d314cc">Drug Interactions (7)</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#LINK_17fd4dd2-0529-477b-907a-3a9739448100">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</linkHtml>]</content>.

                        <paragraph>The effect of other hormonal contraceptive preparations or hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on the pharmacokinetics of lamotrigine has not been systematically evaluated. Other estrogen-containing therapies, such as HRT, may interfere with lamotrigine. Therefore, close clinical monitoring on effectiveness of lamotrigine extended-release tablets with dose adjustment may be necessary <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#LINK_83aac882-9356-4918-a93b-c72ecddbaa25">Warnings and Precautions (5.9)</linkHtml>]</content>. It has been reported that ethinylestradiol, not progestogens, increased the clearance of lamotrigine up to 2-fold, and the progestin-only pills had no effect on lamotrigine plasma levels. Therefore, adjustments to the dosage of lamotrigine extended-release tablets in the presence of progestogens alone will likely not be needed. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>While atazanavir/ritonavir does reduce the lamotrigine plasma concentration, no adjustments to the recommended dose-escalation guidelines for lamotrigine extended-release tablets should be necessary solely based on the use of atazanavir/ritonavir. Dose escalation should follow the recommended guidelines for initiating adjunctive therapy with lamotrigine extended-release tablets based on concomitant AED or other concomitant medications (see Tables 1 and 5). In patients already taking maintenance doses of lamotrigine extended-release tablets and not taking glucuronidation inducers, the dose of lamotrigine extended-release tablets may need to be increased if atazanavir/ritonavir is added or decreased if atazanavir/ritonavir is discontinued <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#LINK_17fd4dd2-0529-477b-907a-3a9739448100">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Experience in patients with hepatic impairment is limited. Based on a clinical pharmacology study in 24 subjects with mild, moderate and severe liver impairment, the following general recommendations can be made <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#LINK_4eaf83cf-83ce-4b44-880a-d91ab241f55d">Use in Specific Populations (8.6)</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#LINK_17fd4dd2-0529-477b-907a-3a9739448100">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</linkHtml>]</content>. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild liver impairment. Initial, escalation and maintenance doses should generally be reduced by approximately 25% in patients with moderate and severe liver impairment without ascites and 50% in patients with severe liver impairment with ascites. Escalation and maintenance doses may be adjusted according to clinical response. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Initial doses of lamotrigine extended-release tablets should be based on patients’ concomitant medications (see Table 1); reduced maintenance doses may be effective for patients with significant renal impairment <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#LINK_ffbad622-e83e-454e-a944-0c93cdbc9806">Use in Specific Populations (8.7)</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#LINK_17fd4dd2-0529-477b-907a-3a9739448100">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</linkHtml>]</content>. Few patients with severe renal impairment have been evaluated during chronic treatment with immediate-release lamotrigine. Because there is inadequate experience in this population, lamotrigine extended-release tablets should be used with caution in these patients.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>For patients receiving lamotrigine extended-release tablets in combination with other AEDs, a re-evaluation of all AEDs in the regimen should be considered if a change in seizure control or an appearance or worsening of adverse reactions is observed. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If a decision is made to discontinue therapy with lamotrigine extended-release tablets, a step-wise reduction of dose over at least 2 weeks (approximately 50% per week) is recommended unless safety concerns require a more rapid withdrawal <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#LINK_db97799b-a1a3-463f-8069-a733cf07cdb9">Warnings and Precautions (5.10)</linkHtml>]</content>. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The risk of serious rash caused by treatment with lamotrigine extended-release is not expected to differ from that with immediate-release lamotrigine <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_bb7ceb11-60f8-401d-96f1-e2c3a6687b98">Boxed Warning</linkHtml>]</content>. However, the relatively limited treatment experience with lamotrigine extended-release makes it difficult to characterize the frequency and risk of serious rashes caused by treatment with lamotrigine extended-release.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The incidence of serious rash associated with hospitalization and discontinuation of immediate-release lamotrigine in a prospectively followed cohort of pediatric patients (aged 2 to 16 years) with epilepsy receiving adjunctive therapy with immediate-release lamotrigine was approximately 0.8% (16 of 1,983). When 14 of these cases were reviewed by 3 expert dermatologists, there was considerable disagreement as to their proper classification. To illustrate, one dermatologist considered none of the cases to be Stevens-Johnson syndrome; another assigned 7 of the 14 to this diagnosis. There was 1 rash-related death in this 1,983-patient cohort. Additionally, there have been rare cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis with and without permanent sequelae and/or death in U.S. and foreign postmarketing experience. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There is evidence that the inclusion of valproate in a multidrug regimen increases the risk of serious, potentially life-threatening rash in pediatric patients. In pediatric patients who used valproate concomitantly, 1.2% (6 of 482) experienced a serious rash compared with 0.6% (6 of 952) patients not taking valproate. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Lamotrigine extended-release is not approved in patients younger than 13 years. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Serious rash associated with hospitalization and discontinuation of immediate-release lamotrigine occurred in 0.3% (11 of 3,348) of adult patients who received immediate-release lamotrigine in premarketing clinical trials of epilepsy. In worldwide postmarketing experience, rare cases of rash-related death have been reported, but their numbers are too few to permit a precise estimate of the rate. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Among the rashes leading to hospitalization were Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, angioedema and those associated with multiorgan hypersensitivity <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_69b026a5-92f6-4677-8e0e-21c3b137865e">Warnings and Precautions (5.3)</linkHtml>]</content>. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There is evidence that the inclusion of valproate in a multidrug regimen increases the risk of serious, potentially life-threatening rash in adults. Specifically, of 584 patients administered immediate-release lamotrigine with valproate in epilepsy clinical trials, 6 (1%) were hospitalized in association with rash; in contrast, 4 (0.16%) of 2,398 clinical trial patients and volunteers administered immediate-release lamotrigine in the absence of valproate were hospitalized. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) has occurred in pediatric and adult patients taking lamotrigine extended-release for various indications. HLH is a life-threatening syndrome of pathologic immune activation characterized by clinical signs and symptoms of extreme systemic inflammation. It is associated with high mortality rates if not recognized early and treated. Common findings include fever, hepatosplenomegaly, rash, lymphadenopathy, neurologic symptoms, cytopenias, high serum ferritin, hypertriglyceridemia, and liver function and coagulation abnormalities. In cases of HLH reported with lamotrigine extended-release, patients have presented with signs of systemic inflammation (fever, rash, hepatosplenomegaly, and organ system dysfunction) and blood dyscrasias. Symptoms have been reported to occur within 8 to 24 days following the initiation of treatment. Patients who develop early manifestations of pathologic immune activation should be evaluated immediately, and a diagnosis of HLH should be considered. Lamotrigine extended-release should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions, also known as drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), have occurred with lamotrigine. Some have been fatal or life threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash and/or lymphadenopathy in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematologic abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis, sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. This disorder is variable in its expression and other organ systems not noted here may be involved.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Fatalities associated with acute multiorgan failure and various degrees of hepatic failure have been reported in 2 of 3,796 adult patients and 4 of 2,435 pediatric patients who received lamotrigine in epilepsy clinical trials. Rare fatalities from multiorgan failure have also been reported in postmarketing use. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Isolated liver failure without rash or involvement of other organs has also been reported with lamotrigine. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy) may be present even though a rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Lamotrigine extended-release should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Prior to initiation of treatment with lamotrigine extended-release, the patient should be instructed that a rash or other signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy) may herald a serious medical event and that the patient should report any such occurrence to a healthcare provider immediately. </paragraph>

Based on these <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> findings, lamotrigine extended-release could slow ventricular conduction (widen QRS) and induce proarrhythmia, which can lead to sudden death, in patients with clinically important structural or functional heart disease (i.e., patients with heart failure, valvular heart disease, congenital heart disease, conduction system disease, ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac channelopathies [e.g., Brugada syndrome], clinically important ischemic heart disease, or multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease). Any expected or observed benefit of lamotrigine extended-release in an individual patient with clinically important structural or functional heart disease must be carefully weighed against the risks for serious arrythmias and/or death for that patient.

                        <paragraph>AEDs, including lamotrigine extended-release, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (monotherapy and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to 1 of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI: 1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared with patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared with 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately 1 case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were 4 suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number of events is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as 1 week after starting treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanism of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Table 3 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Anyone considering prescribing lamotrigine extended-release or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients, their caregivers and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, the emergence of suicidal thoughts or suicidal behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. </paragraph>

                     <title>5.7 Aseptic Meningitis</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Therapy with lamotrigine increases the risk of developing aseptic meningitis. Because of the potential for serious outcomes of untreated meningitis due to other causes, patients should also be evaluated for other causes of meningitis and treated as appropriate. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Postmarketing cases of aseptic meningitis have been reported in pediatric and adult patients taking lamotrigine for various indications. Symptoms upon presentation have included headache, fever, nausea, vomiting and nuchal rigidity. Rash, photophobia, myalgia, chills, altered consciousness and somnolence were also noted in some cases. Symptoms have been reported to occur within 1 day to one and a half months following the initiation of treatment. In most cases, symptoms were reported to resolve after discontinuation of lamotrigine. Re-exposure resulted in a rapid return of symptoms (from within 30 minutes to 1 day following re-initiation of treatment) that were frequently more severe. Some of the patients treated with lamotrigine who developed aseptic meningitis had underlying diagnoses of systemic lupus erythematosus or other autoimmune diseases. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyzed at the time of clinical presentation in reported cases was characterized by a mild to moderate pleocytosis, normal glucose levels and mild to moderate increase in protein. CSF white blood cell count differentials showed a predominance of neutrophils in a majority of the cases, although a predominance of lymphocytes was reported in approximately one third of the cases. Some patients also had new onset of signs and symptoms of involvement of other organs (predominantly hepatic and renal involvement), which may suggest that in these cases the aseptic meningitis observed was part of a hypersensitivity reaction <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_69b026a5-92f6-4677-8e0e-21c3b137865e">Warnings and Precautions (5.3)</linkHtml>]</content>. </paragraph>

                     <title>5.8 Potential Medication Errors</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Medication errors involving lamotrigine extended-release have occurred. In particular, the name lamotrigine can be confused with the names of other commonly used medications. Medication errors may also occur between the different formulations of lamotrigine. To reduce the potential of medication errors, write and say lamotrigine extended-release clearly. Depictions of the lamotrigine extended-release tablets can be found in the Medication Guide. Each lamotrigine extended-release tablet has a distinct color and its own specific debossing <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_a0b45d85-af35-4ea1-b85b-0827eb4c813b">How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)</linkHtml>]</content>. These distinctive features serve to identify the different presentations of the drug and thus may help reduce the risk of medication errors. Lamotrigine extended-release tablets are supplied in round, unit-of-use bottles containing either 30 or 90 tablets. The label on the bottle includes a depiction of the tablets that further communicates to patients and pharmacists that the medication is lamotrigine extended-release and the specific tablet strength included in the bottle. The unit-of-use bottle with a distinctive bottle label features serves to identify the different presentations of the drug and thus may help to reduce the risk of medication errors. To avoid the medication error of using the wrong drug or formulation, patients should be strongly advised to visually inspect their tablets to verify that they are lamotrigine extended-release each time they fill their prescription. </paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Some estrogen-containing oral contraceptives have been shown to decrease serum concentrations of lamotrigine <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#LINK_17fd4dd2-0529-477b-907a-3a9739448100">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</linkHtml>]</content>. Dosage adjustments will be necessary in most patients who start or stop estrogen-containing oral contraceptives while taking lamotrigine extended-release <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#LINK_065bb080-3497-4a85-a0ea-1ac38c73d340">Dosage and Administration (2.1)</linkHtml>]</content>. During the week of inactive hormone preparation (pill-free week) of oral contraceptive therapy, plasma lamotrigine levels are expected to rise, as much as doubling at the end of the week. Adverse reactions consistent with elevated levels of lamotrigine, such as dizziness, ataxia and diplopia, could occur. Other oral contraceptive and other estrogen-containing therapies (such as HRT) have not been studied, though they may similarly affect lamotrigine pharmacokinetic parameters.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>As with other AEDs, lamotrigine extended-release should not be abruptly discontinued. In patients with epilepsy there is a possibility of increasing seizure frequency. Unless safety concerns require a more rapid withdrawal, the dose of lamotrigine extended-release should be tapered over a period of at least 2 weeks (approximately 50% reduction per week) <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_065bb080-3497-4a85-a0ea-1ac38c73d340">Dosage and Administration (2.1)</linkHtml>]</content>. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Valid estimates of the incidence of treatment-emergent status epilepticus among patients treated with immediate-release lamotrigine are difficult to obtain because reporters participating in clinical trials did not all employ identical rules for identifying cases. At a minimum, 7 of 2,343 adult patients had episodes that could unequivocally be described as status epilepticus. In addition, a number of reports of variably defined episodes of seizure exacerbation (e.g., seizure clusters, seizure flurries) were made. </paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Because lamotrigine binds to melanin, it could accumulate in melanin-rich tissues over time. This raises the possibility that lamotrigine may cause toxicity in these tissues after extended use. Although ophthalmological testing was performed in 1 controlled clinical trial, the testing was inadequate to exclude subtle effects or injury occurring after long-term exposure. Moreover, the capacity of available tests to detect potentially adverse consequences, if any, of lamotrigine's binding to melanin is unknown.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Accordingly, although there are no specific recommendations for periodic ophthalmological monitoring, prescribers should be aware of the possibility of long-term ophthalmologic effects. </paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Lamotrigine has been reported to interfere with the assay used in some rapid urine drug screens, which can result in false-positive readings, particularly for phencyclidine (PCP). A more specific analytical method should be used to confirm a positive result. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The value of monitoring plasma concentrations of lamotrigine in patients treated with lamotrigine extended-release has not been established. Because of the possible pharmacokinetic interactions between lamotrigine and other drugs, including AEDs (see Table 6), monitoring of the plasma levels of lamotrigine and concomitant drugs may be indicated, particularly during dosage adjustments. In general, clinical judgment should be exercised regarding monitoring of plasma levels of lamotrigine and other drugs and whether or not dosage adjustments are necessary. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Treatment with lamotrigine extended-release caused an increased incidence of subnormal (below the reference range) values in some hematology analytes (e.g., total white blood cells, monocytes). The treatment effect (Lamotrigine Extended-release % to Placebo %) incidence of subnormal counts was 3% for total white blood cells and 4% for monocytes. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Note: In these trials the incidence of nonserious rash was 2% for lamotrigine extended-release and 3% for placebo. In clinical trials evaluating immediate-release lamotrigine, the rate of serious rash was 0.3% in adults on adjunctive therapy for epilepsy <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_bb7ceb11-60f8-401d-96f1-e2c3a6687b98">Boxed Warning</linkHtml>]</content>. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Adverse reactions were also analyzed to assess the incidence of the onset of an event in the titration period, and in the maintenance period, and if adverse reactions occurring in the titration phase persisted in the maintenance phase. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The incidence for many adverse reactions caused by treatment with lamotrigine extended-release was increased relative to placebo (i.e., treatment difference between lamotrigine extended-release and placebo ≥2%) in either the titration or maintenance phases of the trial. During the titration phase, an increased incidence (shown in descending order of percent treatment difference) was observed for diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, somnolence, vertigo, myalgia, hot flush and anxiety. During the maintenance phase, an increased incidence was observed for dizziness, tremor and diplopia. Some adverse reactions developing in the titration phase were notable for persisting (&gt;7 days) into the maintenance phase. These persistent adverse reactions included somnolence and dizziness. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There were inadequate data to evaluate the effect of dose and/or concentration on the incidence of adverse reactions because, although patients were randomized to different target doses based upon concomitant AEDs, the plasma exposure was expected to be generally similar among all patients receiving different doses. However, in a randomized, parallel trial comparing placebo with 300 and 500 mg/day of immediate-release lamotrigine, the incidence of the most common adverse reactions (≥5%) such as ataxia, blurred vision, diplopia and dizziness were dose related. Less common adverse reactions (&lt;5%) were not assessed for dose-response relationships. </paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Significant drug interactions with lamotrigine are summarized in this section. Additional details of these drug interaction studies, which were conducted using immediate-release lamotrigine, are provided in the Clinical Pharmacology section <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_40da22ab-9880-419c-aac4-3222230c217b">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</linkHtml>]</content>. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Uridine 5´-diphospho-glucuronyl transferases (UGT) have been identified as the enzymes responsible for metabolism of lamotrigine. Drugs that induce or inhibit glucuronidation may, therefore, affect the apparent clearance of lamotrigine. Strong or moderate inducers of the cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzyme, which are also known to induce UGT, may also enhance the metabolism of lamotrigine.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Those drugs that have been demonstrated to have a clinically significant impact on lamotrigine metabolism are outlined in Table 13. Specific dosing guidance for these drugs is provided in the Dosage and Administration section, and, for women taking estrogen-containing products, including oral contraceptives, in the Warnings and Precautions section <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#LINK_065bb080-3497-4a85-a0ea-1ac38c73d340">Dosage and Administration (2.1)</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#LINK_83aac882-9356-4918-a93b-c72ecddbaa25">Warnings and Precautions, (5.9)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to AEDs, including lamotrigine extended-release, during pregnancy. Encourage women who are taking lamotrigine extended-release during pregnancy to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry by calling 1-888-233-2334 or visiting http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Data from several prospective pregnancy exposure registries and epidemiological studies of pregnant women have not detected an increased frequency of major congenital malformations or a consistent pattern of malformations among women exposed to lamotrigine compared with the general population <content styleCode="italics">(see <linkHtml href="#LINK_c5f71a92-b353-4104-9816-cbadd1527db4">Data</linkHtml>)</content>. In animal studies, administration of lamotrigine during pregnancy resulted in developmental toxicity (increased mortality, decreased body weight, increased structural variation, neurobehavioral abnormalities) at doses lower than those administered clinically. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Lamotrigine decreased fetal folate concentrations in rats, an effect known to be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes in animals and humans <content styleCode="italics">(see <linkHtml href="#LINK_c5f71a92-b353-4104-9816-cbadd1527db4">Data</linkHtml>)</content>. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>As with other AEDs, physiological changes during pregnancy may affect lamotrigine concentrations and/or therapeutic effect. There have been reports of decreased lamotrigine concentrations during pregnancy and restoration of pre-pregnancy concentrations after delivery. Dose adjustments may be necessary to maintain clinical response. </paragraph>

                                 <content styleCode="italics">Human Data: </content>Data from several international pregnancy registries have not shown an increased risk for malformations overall. The International Lamotrigine Pregnancy Registry reported major congenital malformations in 2.2% (95% CI: 1.6%, 3.1%) of 1,558 infants exposed to lamotrigine monotherapy in the first trimester of pregnancy. The NAAED Pregnancy Registry reported major congenital malformations among 2.0% of 1,562 infants exposed to lamotrigine monotherapy in the first trimester. EURAP, a large international pregnancy registry focused outside of North America, reported major birth defects in 2.9% (95% CI: 2.3%, 3.7%) of 2,514 exposures to lamotrigine monotherapy in the first trimester. The frequency of major congenital malformations was similar to estimates from the general population.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The NAAED Pregnancy Registry observed an increased risk of isolated oral clefts: among 2,200 infants exposed to lamotrigine early in pregnancy, the risk of oral clefts was 3.2 per 1,000 (95% CI: 1.4, 6.3), a 3-fold increased risk versus unexposed healthy controls. This finding has not been observed in other large international pregnancy registries. Furthermore, a case-control study based on 21 congenital anomaly registries covering over 10 million births in Europe reported an adjusted odds ratio for isolated oral clefts with lamotrigine exposure of 1.45 (95% CI: 0.8, 2.63).</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Several meta-analyses have not reported an increased risk of major congenital malformations following lamotrigine exposure in pregnancy compared with healthy and disease-matched controls. No patterns of specific malformation types were observed.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The same meta-analyses evaluated the risk of additional maternal and infant outcomes including fetal death, stillbirth, preterm birth, small for gestational age, and neurodevelopmental delay. Although there are no data suggesting an increased risk of these outcomes with lamotrigine monotherapy exposure, differences in outcome definition, ascertainment methods, and comparator groups limit the conclusions that can be drawn.</paragraph>

The no-effect doses for embryofetal developmental toxicity in mice, rats, and rabbits (75, 6.25, and 30 mg/kg, respectively) are similar to (mice and rabbits) or less than (rats) the human dose of 400 mg/day on a body surface area (mg/m<sup>2</sup>) basis.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>In a study in which pregnant rats were administered lamotrigine (oral doses of 0, 5 or 25 mg/kg) during the period of organogenesis and offspring were evaluated postnatally, neurobehavioral abnormalities were observed in exposed offspring at both doses. The lowest effect dose for developmental neurotoxicity in rats is less than the human dose of 400 mg/day on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis. Maternal toxicity was observed at the higher dose tested.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>When pregnant rats were administered lamotrigine (oral doses of 0, 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg) during the latter part of gestation and throughout lactation, increased offspring mortality (including stillbirths) was seen at all doses.

Neonates and young infants are at risk for high serum levels because maternal serum and milk levels can rise to high levels postpartum if lamotrigine dosage has been increased during pregnancy but is not reduced after delivery to the pre-pregnancy dosage. Glucuronidation is required for drug clearance. Glucuronidation capacity is immature in the infant and this may also contribute to the level of lamotrigine exposure. Events including rash, apnea, drowsiness, poor sucking, and poor weight gain (requiring hospitalization in some cases) have been reported in infants who have been human milk-fed by mothers using lamotrigine; whether or not these events were caused by lamotrigine is unknown. No data are available on the effects of the drug on milk production. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for lamotrigine extended-release and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from lamotrigine extended-release or from the underlying maternal condition. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>There are no specific antidotes for lamotrigine. Following a suspected overdose, hospitalization of the patient is advised. General supportive care is indicated, including frequent monitoring of vital signs and close observation of the patient. If indicated, emesis should be induced; usual precautions should be taken to protect the airway. It is uncertain whether hemodialysis is an effective means of removing lamotrigine from the blood. In 6 renal failure patients, about 20% of the amount of lamotrigine in the body was removed by hemodialysis during a 4-hour session. A Poison Control Center should be contacted for information on the management of overdosage of lamotrigine extended-release. </paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The precise mechanism(s) by which lamotrigine exerts its anticonvulsant action are unknown. In animal models designed to detect anticonvulsant activity, lamotrigine was effective in preventing seizure spread in the maximum electroshock (MES) and pentylenetetrazol (scMet) tests, and prevented seizures in the visually and electrically evoked after-discharge (EEAD) tests for antiepileptic activity. Lamotrigine also displayed inhibitory properties in the kindling model in rats both during kindling development and in the fully kindled state. The relevance of these models to human epilepsy, however, is not known. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>One proposed mechanism of action of lamotrigine, the relevance of which remains to be established in humans, involves an effect on sodium channels. <content styleCode="italics">In vitro</content> pharmacological studies suggest that lamotrigine inhibits voltage-sensitive sodium channels, thereby stabilizing neuronal membranes and consequently modulating presynaptic transmitter release of excitatory amino acids (e.g., glutamate and aspartate). </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Lamotrigine did not inhibit N-methyl d-aspartate (NMDA)-induced depolarizations in rat cortical slices or NMDA-induced cyclic GMP formation in immature rat cerebellum, nor did lamotrigine displace compounds that are either competitive or noncompetitive ligands at this glutamate receptor complex (CNQX, CGS, TCHP). The IC<sub>50</sub> for lamotrigine effects on NMDA-induced currents (in the presence of 3 μM of glycine) in cultured hippocampal neurons exceeded 100 μM. </paragraph>

Elevated heart rates could also increase the risk of ventricular conduction slowing with lamotrigine extended-release.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In comparison with immediate-release lamotrigine, the plasma lamotrigine levels following administration of lamotrigine extended-release are not associated with any significant changes in trough plasma concentrations, and are characterized by lower peaks, longer time to peaks and lower peak-to-trough fluctuation, as described in detail below. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Lamotrigine is absorbed after oral administration with negligible first-pass metabolism. The bioavailability of lamotrigine is not affected by food. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In an open-label, crossover study of 44 subjects with epilepsy receiving concomitant AEDs, the steady-state pharmacokinetics of lamotrigine were compared following administration of equivalent total doses of lamotrigine extended-release given once daily with those of lamotrigine immediate-release given twice daily. In this study, the median time to peak concentration (T<sub>max</sub>) following administration of lamotrigine extended-release was 4 to 6 hours in subjects taking carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, or primidone; 9 to 11 hours in subjects taking valproate; and 6 to 10 hours in subjects taking AEDs other than carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or valproate. In comparison, the median T<sub>max</sub> following administration of immediate-release lamotrigine was between 1 and 1.5 hours. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The steady-state trough concentrations for extended-release lamotrigine were similar to or higher than those of immediate-release lamotrigine depending on concomitant AED (see Table 6). A mean reduction in the lamotrigine C<sub>max</sub> by 11% to 29% was observed for lamotrigine extended-release compared with immediate-release lamotrigine, resulting in a decrease in the peak-to-trough fluctuation in serum lamotrigine concentrations. However, in some subjects receiving enzyme-inducing AEDs, a reduction in C<sub>max</sub> of 44% to 77% was observed. The degree of fluctuation was reduced by 17% in subjects taking enzyme-inducing AEDs; 34% in subjects taking valproate; and 37% in subjects taking AEDs other than carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or valproate. Lamotrigine extended-release and immediate-release lamotrigine regimens were similar with respect to area under the curve (AUC, a measure of the extent of bioavailability) for subjects receiving AEDs other than those known to induce the metabolism of lamotrigine. The relative bioavailability of extended-release lamotrigine was approximately 21% lower than immediate-release lamotrigine in subjects receiving enzyme-inducing AEDs. However, a reduction in exposure of up to 70% was observed in some subjects in this group when they switched to lamotrigine extended-release. Therefore, doses may need to be adjusted in some patients based on therapeutic response.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In healthy volunteers not receiving any other medications and given lamotrigine extended-release once daily, the systemic exposure to lamotrigine increased in direct proportion to the dose administered over the range of 50 mg to 200 mg. At doses between 25 mg and 50 mg, the increase was less than dose proportional, with a 2-fold increase in dose resulting in an approximately 1.6-fold increase in systemic exposure. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Estimates of the mean apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) of lamotrigine following oral administration ranged from 0.9 to 1.3 L/kg. Vd/F is independent of dose and is similar following single and multiple doses in both patients with epilepsy and in healthy volunteers. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Data from <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> studies indicate that lamotrigine is approximately 55% bound to human plasma proteins at plasma lamotrigine concentrations from 1 to 10 mcg/mL (10 mcg/mL is 4 to 6 times the trough plasma concentration observed in the controlled efficacy trials). Because lamotrigine is not highly bound to plasma proteins, clinically significant interactions with other drugs through competition for protein binding sites are unlikely. The binding of lamotrigine to plasma proteins did not change in the presence of therapeutic concentrations of phenytoin, phenobarbital, or valproate. Lamotrigine did not displace other AEDs (carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital) from protein-binding sites. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Lamotrigine is metabolized predominantly by glucuronic acid conjugation; the major metabolite is an inactive 2-N-glucuronide conjugate. After oral administration of 240 mg of <sup>14</sup>C-lamotrigine (15 μCi) to 6 healthy volunteers, 94% was recovered in the urine and 2% was recovered in the feces. The radioactivity in the urine consisted of unchanged lamotrigine (10%), the 2-N-glucuronide (76%), a 5-N-glucuronide (10%), a 2-N-methyl metabolite (0.14%) and other unidentified minor metabolites (4%). </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The effects of lamotrigine on the induction of specific families of mixed-function oxidase isozymes have not been systematically evaluated. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Following multiple administrations (150 mg twice daily) to normal volunteers taking no other medications, lamotrigine induced its own metabolism, resulting in a 25% decrease in t<sub>1/2;</sub> and a 37% increase in CL/F at steady-state compared with values obtained in the same volunteers following a single dose. Evidence gathered from other sources suggests that self-induction by lamotrigine may not occur when lamotrigine is given as adjunctive therapy in patients receiving enzyme-inducing drugs such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_502b69ea-bc62-44f2-99bf-3b1e2befd8e4">Drug Interactions (7)</linkHtml>]</content>. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The elimination half-life and apparent clearance of lamotrigine following oral administration of immediate-release lamotrigine to adult subjects with epilepsy and healthy volunteers is summarized in Table 7. Half-life and apparent oral clearance vary depending on concomitant AEDs. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Since the half-life of lamotrigine following administration of single-doses of immediate-release lamotrigine is comparable with that observed following administration of lamotrigine extended-release, similar changes in the half-life of lamotrigine would be expected for lamotrigine extended-release. </paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In 16 female volunteers, an oral contraceptive preparation containing 30 mcg ethinylestradiol and 150 mcg levonorgestrel increased the apparent clearance of lamotrigine (300 mg/day) by approximately 2-fold with mean decreases in AUC of 52% and in C<sub>max</sub> of 39%. In this study, trough serum lamotrigine concentrations gradually increased and were approximately 2-fold higher on average at the end of the week of the inactive hormone preparation compared with trough lamotrigine concentrations at the end of the active hormone cycle. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Gradual transient increases in lamotrigine plasma levels (approximate 2-fold increase) occurred during the week of inactive hormone preparation (pill-free week) for women not also taking a drug that increased the clearance of lamotrigine (carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation) <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_502b69ea-bc62-44f2-99bf-3b1e2befd8e4">Drug Interactions (7)</linkHtml>]</content>. The increase in lamotrigine plasma levels will be greater if the dose of lamotrigine extended-release is increased in the few days before or during the pill-free week. Increases in lamotrigine plasma levels could result in dose-dependent adverse reactions.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In the same study, co-administration of lamotrigine (300 mg/day) in 16 female volunteers did not affect the pharmacokinetics of the ethinylestradiol component of the oral contraceptive preparation. There were mean decreases in the AUC and C<sub>max</sub> of the levonorgestrel component of 19% and 12%, respectively. Measurement of serum progesterone indicated that there was no hormonal evidence of ovulation in any of the 16 volunteers, although measurement of serum FSH, LH and estradiol indicated that there was some loss of suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The effects of doses of lamotrigine other than 300 mg/day have not been systematically evaluated in controlled clinical trials. Studies with other female hormonal preparations (including progesterone/progesterone-containing HRT) have not been conducted.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The clinical significance of the observed hormonal changes on ovulatory activity is unknown. However, the possibility of decreased contraceptive efficacy in some patients cannot be excluded. Therefore, patients should be instructed to promptly report changes in their menstrual pattern (e.g., break-through bleeding). </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Dosage adjustments may be necessary for women receiving estrogen-containing products, including oral contraceptive preparations <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#LINK_065bb080-3497-4a85-a0ea-1ac38c73d340">Dosage and Administration (2.1)</linkHtml>]</content>. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The effect of other hormonal contraceptive preparations or HRT on the pharmacokinetics of lamotrigine has not been systematically evaluated. It has been reported that ethinylestradiol, not progestogens, increased the clearance of lamotrigine up to 2-fold, and the progestin-only pills had no effect on lamotrigine plasma levels. Therefore, adjustments to the dosage of lamotrigine extended-release in the presence of progestogens alone will likely not be needed. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In 18 patients with bipolar disorder on a stable regimen of 100 to 400 mg/day of lamotrigine, the lamotrigine AUC and C<sub>max</sub> were reduced by approximately 10% in patients who received aripiprazole 10 to 30 mg/day for 7 days, followed by 30 mg/day for an additional 7 days. This reduction in lamotrigine exposure is not considered clinically meaningful. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In a study in healthy volunteers, daily doses of atazanavir/ritonavir (300 mg/100 mg) reduced the plasma AUC and C<sub>max</sub> of lamotrigine (single 100-mg dose) by an average of 32% and 6%, respectively, and shortened the elimination half-lives by 27%. In the presence of atazanavir/ritonavir (300 mg/100 mg), the metabolite-to-lamotrigine ratio was increased from 0.45 to 0.71 consistent with induction of glucuronidation. The pharmacokinetics of atazanavir/ritonavir were similar in the presence of concomitant lamotrigine to the historical data of the pharmacokinetics in the absence of lamotrigine. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Lamotrigine has no appreciable effect on steady-state carbamazepine plasma concentration. Limited clinical data suggest there is a higher incidence of dizziness, diplopia, ataxia and blurred vision in patients receiving carbamazepine with lamotrigine than in patients receiving other AEDs with lamotrigine <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_6b7a7e9d-9792-40fa-ada5-b8fdaa4470eb">Adverse Reactions (6.1)</linkHtml>]</content>. The mechanism of this interaction is unclear. The effect of lamotrigine on plasma concentrations of carbamazepine-epoxide is unclear. In a small subset of patients (n = 7) studied in a placebo-controlled trial, lamotrigine had no effect on carbamazepine-epoxide plasma concentrations, but in a small, uncontrolled study (n = 9), carbamazepine-epoxide levels increased. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The addition of carbamazepine decreases lamotrigine steady-state concentrations by approximately 40%. </paragraph>

                     <title>14.1 Adjunctive Therapy for Primary Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The effectiveness of lamotrigine extended-release as adjunctive therapy in subjects with PGTC seizures was established in a 19-week, international, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 143 patients aged 13 years and older (n = 70 on lamotrigine extended-release,  n = 73 on placebo). Patients with at least 3 PGTC seizures during an 8-week baseline phase were randomized to 19 weeks of treatment with lamotrigine extended-release or placebo added to their current AED regimen of up to 2 drugs. Patients were dosed on a fixed-dose regimen, with target doses ranging from 200 to 500 mg/day of lamotrigine extended-release based on concomitant AEDs (target dose = 200 mg for valproate, 300 mg for AEDs not altering plasma lamotrigine levels and 500 mg for enzyme-inducing AEDs).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The primary efficacy endpoint was percent change from baseline in PGTC seizure frequency during the double-blind treatment phase. For the intent-to-treat population, the median percent reduction in PGTC seizure frequency was 75% in patients treated with lamotrigine extended-release and 32% in patients treated with placebo, a difference that was statistically significant, defined as a 2-sided <content styleCode="italics">P</content> value ≤0.05. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Figure 1 presents the percentage of patients (X-axis) with a percent reduction in PGTC seizure frequency (responder rate) from baseline through the entire treatment period at least as great as that represented on the Y-axis. A positive value on the Y-axis indicates an improvement from baseline (i.e., a decrease in seizure frequency), while a negative value indicates a worsening from baseline (i.e., an increase in seizure frequency). Thus, in a display of this type, a curve for an effective treatment is shifted to the left of the curve for placebo. The proportion of patients achieving any particular level of reduction in PGTC seizure frequency was consistently higher for the group treated with lamotrigine extended-release compared with the placebo group. For example, 70% of patients randomized to lamotrigine extended-release experienced a 50% or greater reduction in PGTC seizure frequency, compared with 32% of patients randomized to placebo. Patients with an increase in seizure frequency &gt;100% are represented on the Y-axis as ≥ -100%. </paragraph>

Approximately 36% were from the U.S. and approximately 64% were from other countries including Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Germany, India, Korea, Russian Federation and Ukraine. Patients with at least 8 partial-onset seizures during an 8-week prospective baseline phase (or 4-week prospective baseline coupled with a 4-week historical baseline documented with seizure diary data) were randomized to treatment with lamotrigine extended-release (n = 116) or placebo (n = 120) added to their current regimen of 1 or 2 AEDs. Approximately half of the patients were taking 2 concomitant AEDs at baseline. Target doses ranged from 200 to 500 mg/day of lamotrigine extended-release based on concomitant AED (target dose = 200 mg for valproate, 300 mg for AEDs not altering plasma lamotrigine and 500 mg for enzyme-inducing AEDs). The median partial seizure frequency per week at baseline was 2.3 for lamotrigine extended-release and 2.1 for placebo. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The primary endpoint was the median percent change from baseline in partial-onset seizure frequency during the entire double-blind treatment phase. The median percent reductions in weekly partial-onset seizures were 47% in patients treated with lamotrigine extended-release and 25% on placebo, a difference that was statistically significant, defined as a 2-sided <content styleCode="italics">P</content> value ≤0.05. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Figure 2 presents the percentage of patients (X-axis) with a percent reduction in partial-onset seizure frequency (responder rate) from baseline through the entire treatment period at least as great as that represented on the Y-axis. The proportion of patients achieving any particular level of reduction in partial-onset seizure frequency was consistently higher for the group treated with lamotrigine extended-release compared with the placebo group. For example, 44% of patients randomized to lamotrigine extended-release experienced a 50% or greater reduction in partial-onset seizure frequency compared with 21% of patients randomized to placebo.</paragraph>

                     <title>14.3 Conversion to Monotherapy for Partial-Onset Seizures</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The effectiveness of lamotrigine extended-release as monotherapy for partial-onset seizures was established in a historical control trial in 223 adults with partial-onset seizures. The historical control methodology is described in a publication by French, et al. <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_07cda5ec-b313-410d-83b8-05a139869fc8">References (15)</linkHtml>]</content>. Briefly, in this study, patients were randomized to ultimately receive either lamotrigine extended-release 300 or 250 mg once a day, and their responses were compared with those of a historical control group. The historical control consisted of a pooled analysis of the control groups from 8 studies of similar design, which utilized a subtherapeutic dose of an AED as a comparator. Statistical superiority to the historical control was considered to be demonstrated if the upper 95% confidence interval for the proportion of patients meeting escape criteria in patients receiving lamotrigine extended-release remained below the lower 95% prediction interval of 65.3% derived from the historical control data. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In this study, patients aged 13 years and older experienced at least 4 partial-onset seizures during an 8-week baseline period with at least 1 seizure occurring during each of 2 consecutive 4-week periods while receiving valproate or a non–enzyme-inducing AED. Lamotrigine extended-release was added to either valproate or a non-enzyme-inducing AED over a 6- to 7-week period followed by the gradual withdrawal of the background AED. Patients were then continued on monotherapy with lamotrigine extended-release for 12 weeks. The escape criteria were 1 or more of the following: (1) doubling of average monthly seizure count during any 28 consecutive days, (2) doubling of highest consecutive 2-day seizure frequency during the entire treatment phase, (3) emergence of a new seizure type compared with baseline (4) clinically significant prolongation of generalized tonic-clonic seizures or worsening of seizure considered by the investigator to require intervention. These criteria were similar to those in the 8 controlled trials from which the historical control group was constituted. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The upper 95% confidence limits of the proportion of subjects meeting escape criteria (40.2% at 300 mg/day and 44.5% at 250 mg/day) were below the threshold of 65.3% derived from the historical control data. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Although the study population was not fully comparable with the historical control population and the study was not fully blinded, numerous sensitivity analyses supported the primary results. Efficacy was further supported by the established effectiveness of the immediate-release formulation as monotherapy. </paragraph>
